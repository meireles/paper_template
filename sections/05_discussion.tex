\section{Discussion}

My results show that acorns that passed through a gator's GI tract have higher germination rates. This is consistent with the results from \textcite{CavenderBares2027}.

One caveat of my study is that Billy had eaten a jogger and two cats a week before the acorn experiment, which may have influenced the result.
