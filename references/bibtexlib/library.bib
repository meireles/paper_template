abstract = {Phylogeographical analyses have become commonplace for a myriad of organisms with the advent of cheap DNA sequencing technologies. Bayesian model-based clustering is a powerful tool for detecting important patterns in such data and can be used to decipher even quite subtle signals of systematic differences in molecular variation. Here, we introduce two upgrades to the Bayesian Analysis of Population Structure (BAPS) software, which enable 1) spatially explicit modeling of variation in DNA sequences and 2) hierarchical clustering of DNA sequence data to reveal nested genetic population structures. We provide a direct interface to map the results from spatial clustering with Google Maps using the portal http://www.spatialepidemiology.net/ and illustrate this approach using sequence data from Borrelia burgdorferi. The usefulness of hierarchical clustering is demonstrated through an analysis of the metapopulation structure within a bacterial population experiencing a high level of local horizontal gene transfer. The tools that are introduced are freely available at http://www.helsinki.fi/bsg/software/BAPS/.},

abstract = {It is debated whether species-level differences in ecological strategy, which play a key role in much of coexistence theory, are important in structuring highly diverse communities. We examined the co-occurrence patterns of over 1100 tree species in a 25-hectare Amazonian forest plot in relation to field-measured functional traits. Using a null model approach, we show that co-occurring trees are often less ecologically similar than a niche-free (neutral) model predicts. Furthermore, we find evidence for processes that simultaneously drive convergence and divergence in key aspects of plant strategy, suggesting that at least two distinct niche-based processes are occurring. Our results show that strategy differentiation among species contributes to the maintenance of diversity in one of the most diverse tropical forests in the world.},

abstract = {Recent studies of Northern Hemisphere biogeography have highlighted potentially significant differences between disjunction patterns in plants versus animals. To assess such differences, we compiled a larger sample of relevant plant phylogenies from which disjunction patterns, ancestral areas and directions of movement could be inferred. We considered 66 plant clades with species variously endemic today to eastern Asia (EA), Europe (including southwestern Asia), eastern North America (ENA), and/or western North America (WNA). Within these clades we focused on 100 disjunctions among these major areas, for 33 of which absolute divergence times have also been inferred. Our analyses uphold the view that disjunctions between EA and ENA are exceptionally common in plants, apparently more so than in animals. Compared with animals, we find few disjunctions between EA and WNA, consistent with increased extinction in WNA or failure of some groups to colonize that region. Taken at face value, our data also support the view that many temperate forest plant groups originated and diversified within EA, followed by movement out of Asia at different times, but mostly during the last 30 Myr. This favours Beringia over a North Atlantic land bridge as the primary path between the Old World and the New World. Additional studies are needed, especially to evaluate the impacts of differential extinction on these patterns, to more confidently establish divergence times, and to assess the statistical significance of these findings. Fortunately, many more plant groups show relevant disjunction patterns and could soon be added to such analyses.},

abstract = {Phylobetadiversity incorporates phylogenetic information and beta diversity, and can account for the ecological similarities between communities with a phylogenetic perspective. Although different phylobetadiversity indices reflect differences in different characteristics between communities, the results of different phylobetadiversity indices are not comparable. In this study we examined phylobetadiversity indices for a 24-hm 2 plot in the Gutianshan National Nature Reserve. It was found the abundance-weighted D pw was almost identical to Rao{\^{a}}s D of Rao{\^{a}}s quadratic entropy. PhyloSor had a similar ecological meaning and algorithm to UniFrac. Although D nn was different in definition from UniFrac and PhyloSor, they were all strongly correlated. The effect of species abundance on phylobetadiversity was not significant when scales were relatively small, but was significant at larger scales. These contrasts likely resulted from reductions in evenness in communities as scales increased. P ST and Rao{\^{a}}s H better reflected the distance-decay changes caused by spatial and habitat variation than other indices at larger scales, whereas AW- D nn and D nn better reflected these changes at small scales.},

abstract = {Since its introduction in 2001, MrBayes has grown in popularity as a software package for Bayesian phylogenetic inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. With this note, we announce the release of version 3.2, a major upgrade to the latest official release presented in 2003. The new version provides convergence diagnostics and allows multiple analyses to be run in parallel with convergence progress monitored on the fly. The introduction of new proposals and automatic optimization of tuning parameters has improved convergence for many problems. The new version also sports significantly faster likelihood calculations through streaming single-instruction-multiple-data extensions (SSE) and support of the BEAGLE library, allowing likelihood calculations to be delegated to graphics processing units (GPUs) on compatible hardware. Speedup factors range from around 2 with SSE code to more than 50 with BEAGLE for codon problems. Checkpointing across all models allows long runs to be completed even when an analysis is prematurely terminated. New models include relaxed clocks, dating, model averaging across time-reversible substitution models, and support for hard, negative, and partial (backbone) tree constraints. Inference of species trees from gene trees is supported by full incorporation of the Bayesian estimation of species trees (BEST) algorithms. Marginal model likelihoods for Bayes factor tests can be estimated accurately across the entire model space using the stepping stone method. The new version provides more output options than previously, including samples of ancestral states, site rates, site d(N)/d(S) rations, branch rates, and node dates. A wide range of statistics on tree parameters can also be output for visualization in FigTree and compatible software.},

@article{Lavorel2002,
abstract = {Summary  1.   The concept of plant functional type proposes that species can be grouped according to common responses to the environment and/or common effects on ecosystem processes. However, the knowledge of relationships between traits associated with the response of plants to environmental factors such as resources and disturbances (response traits), and traits that determine effects of plants on ecosystem functions (effect traits), such as biogeochemical cycling or propensity to disturbance, remains rudimentary.  2.   We present a framework using concepts and results from community ecology, ecosystem ecology and evolutionary biology to provide this linkage. Ecosystem functioning is the end result of the operation of multiple environmental filters in a hierarchy of scales which, by selecting individuals with appropriate responses, result in assemblages with varying trait composition. Functional linkages and trade-offs among traits, each of which relates to one or several processes, determine whether or not filtering by different factors gives a match, and whether ecosystem effects can be easily deduced from the knowledge of the filters.  3.   To illustrate this framework we analyse a set of key environmental factors and ecosystem processes. While traits associated with response to nutrient gradients strongly overlapped with those determining net primary production, little direct overlap was found between response to fire and flammability.  4.   We hypothesize that these patterns reflect general trends. Responses to resource availability would be determined by traits that are also involved in biogeochemical cycling, because both these responses and effects are driven by the trade-off between acquisition and conservation. On the other hand, regeneration and demographic traits associated with response to disturbance, which are known to have little connection with adult traits involved in plant ecophysiology, would be of little relevance to ecosystem processes.  5.   This framework is likely to be broadly applicable, although caution must be exercised to use trait linkages and trade-offs appropriate to the scale, environmental conditions and evolutionary context. It may direct the selection of plant functional types for vegetation models at a range of scales, and help with the design of experimental studies of relationships between plant diversity and ecosystem properties.},

abstract = {Divergent natural selection has been shown to promote speciation in many taxa. However, although divergent selection often initiates the process of speciation, it often fails to complete it. Several time-based, geographic and genetic factors have been recognized to explain this variability in how far speciation proceeds. We review here recent evidence indicating that variability in the completeness of speciation can also be associated with the nature of divergent selection itself, with speciation being greatly promoted by (i) stronger selection on a given, single trait (the 'stronger selection' hypothesis) and (ii) selection on a greater number of traits (the 'multifarious selection' hypothesis). However, evidence for each selective hypothesis is still scarce, and further work is required to determine their relative importance. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

I describe two indices that use the number of nodes that separate taxa on a phylogeny as a measure of their phylogenetic relatedness. As an example of the use of these indices in community analysis, I compared the mean observed net relatedness of trees ({\textgreater}/=10 cm diameter at breast height) in each of 28 plots (each 0.16 ha) in a Bornean rain forest with the net relatedness expected if species were drawn randomly from the species pool (of the 324 species in the 28 plots), using a supertree that I assembled from published sources. I found that the species in plots were more phylogenetically related than expected by chance, a result that was insensitive to various modifications to the basic methodology. I tentatively infer that variation in habitat among plots causes ecologically more similar species to co-occur within plots. Finally, I suggest a range of applications for phylogenetic relatedness measures in community analysis.},

abstract = {We have compared the sequence organization of four previously uncharacterized legume chloroplast DNAs - from alfalfa, lupine, wisteria and subclover - to that of legume chloroplast DNAs that either retain a large, ribosomal RNA-encoding inverted repeat (mung bean) or have deleted one half of this repeat (broad bean). The circular, 126 kilobase pair (kb) alfalfa chloroplast genome, like those of broad bean and pea, lacks any detectable repeated sequences and contains only a single set of ribosomal RNA genes. However, in contrast to broad bean and pea, alfalfa chloroplast DNA is unrearranged (except for the deletion of one segment of the inverted repeat) relative to chloroplast DNA from mung bean. Together with other findings reported here, these results allow us to determine which of the four possible inverted repeat configurations was deleted in the alfalfa-pea-broad bean lineage, and to show how the present-day broad bean genome may have been derived from an alfalfa-like ancestral genome by two major sequence inversions. The 147 kb lupine chloroplast genome contains a 22 kb inverted repeat and has essentially complete colinearity with the mung bean genome. In contrast, the 130 kb wisteria genome has deleted one half of the inverted repeat and appears colinear with the alfalfa genome. The 140 kb subclover genome has been extensively rearranged and contains a family of at least five dispersed repetitive sequence elements, each several hundred by in size; this is the first report of dispersed repeats of this size in a land plant chloroplast genome. We conclude that the inverted repeat has been lost only once among legumes and that this loss occurred prior to all the other rearrangements observed in subclover, broad bean and pea. Of those lineages that lack the inverted repeat, some are stable and unrearranged, other have undergone a moderate amount of rearrangement, while still others have sustained a complex series of rearrangement either with or without major sequence duplications and transpositions. {\textcopyright} 1987 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Biodiversity loss is proceeding at an unprecedented rate, yet we lack a thorough understanding of the consequences of losing diversity at different scales. While species diversity is known to impact community and ecosystem processes, genotypic diversity is assumed to have relatively smaller effects. Nonetheless, a few recent studies suggest that genotypic diversity may have quantitatively similar ecological consequences compared to species diversity. Here we show that increasing either genotypic diversity of common evening primrose (Oenothera biennis) or species diversity of old-field plant species resulted in nearly equivalent increases (approximately 17{\%}) in aboveground primary production. The predominant mechanism explaining this effect, niche complementarity, was similar for each type of diversity. Arthropod species richness also increased with both types of plant diversity, but the mechanisms leading to this effect differed: abundance-driven accumulation of arthropod species was important in plant genotypic polycultures, whereas resource specialization was important in plant species polycultures. Thus, similar increases in primary productivity differentially impacted higher trophic levels in response to each type of plant diversity. These results highlight important ecological similarities and differences between genotypic and species diversity and suggest that genotypic diversity may play a larger role in community and ecosystem processes than previously realized.},

abstract = {    Phylogenetic relationships among 122 species of Lauraceae representing 44 of the 55 currently recognized genera are inferred from sequence variation in the chloroplast and nuclear genomes. The trnL-trnF, trnT-trnL, psbA-trnH, and rpl16 regions of cpDNA, and the 5? end of 26S rDNA resolved major lineages, while the ITS/5.8S region of rDNA resolved a large terminal clade. The phylogenetic estimate is used to assess morphology-based views of relationships and, with a temporal dimension added, to reconstruct the biogeographic history of the family. Results suggest Lauraceae radiated when trans-Tethyean migration was relatively easy, and basal lineages are established on either Gondwanan or Laurasian terrains by the Late Cretaceous. Most genera with Gondwanan histories place in Cryptocaryeae, but a small group of South American genera, the Chlorocardium–Mezilaurus clade, represent a separate Gondwanan lineage. Caryodaphnopsis and Neocinnamomum may be the only extant representatives of the ancient Lauraceae flora documented in Mid- to Late Cretaceous Laurasian strata. Remaining genera place in a terminal Perseeae–Laureae clade that radiated in Early Eocene Laurasia. Therein, non-cupulate genera associate as the Persea group, and cupuliferous genera sort to Laureae of most classifications or Cinnamomeae sensu Kostermans. Laureae are Laurasian relicts in Asia. The Persea group and Cinnamomum group (of Cinnamomeae) show tropical amphi-Pacific disjunctions here credited to disruption of boreotropical ranges by Eocene–Oligocene climatic cooling.

abstract = {Regional phylogeographical studies involving co-distributed animal and plant species have been conducted for several areas, most notably for Europe and the Pacific Northwest of North America. Until recently, phylogeographical studies in unglaciated eastern North America have been largely limited to animals. As more studies emerge for diverse lineages (including plants), it seems timely to assess the phylogeography across this region: (i) comparing and contrasting the patterns seen in plants and animals; (ii) assessing the extent of pseudocongruence; and (iii) discussing the potential applications of regional phylogeography to issues in ecology, such as response to climatic change. Unglaciated eastern North America is a large, geologically and topographically complex area with the species examined having diverse distributions. Nonetheless, some recurrent patterns emerge: (i) maritime - Atlantic vs. Gulf Coast; (ii) Apalachicola River discontinuity; (iii) Tombigbee River discontinuity; (iv) the Appalachian Mountain discontinuity; (v) the Mississippi River discontinuity; and (vi) the Apalachicola River and Mississippi River discontinuities. Although initially documented in animals, most of these patterns are also apparent in plants, providing support for phylogeographical generalizations. These patterns may generally be attributable to isolation and differentiation during Pleistocene glaciation, but in some cases may be older (Pliocene). Molecular studies sometimes agree with longstanding hypotheses of glacial refugia, but also suggest additional possible refugia, such as the southern Appalachian Mountains and areas close to the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Many species exhibit distinct patterns that reflect the unique, rather than the shared, aspects of species' phylogeographical histories. Furthermore, similar modern phylogeographical patterns can result from different underlying causal factors operating at different times (i.e. pseudocongruence). One underemphasized component of pseudocongruence may result from the efforts of researchers to categorize patterns visually - similar patterns may, in fact, not fully coincide, and inferring agreement may obscure the actual patterns and lead to erroneous conclusions. Our modelling analyses indicate no clear spatial patterning and support the hypothesis that phylogeographical structure in diverse temperate taxa is complex and was not shaped by just a few barriers.},

abstract = {The processes that structure assemblages of species in hyper-diverse genera, such as Ficus (Moraceae), are not well understood. Functional diversity of co-occurring species can reveal evidence for assembly processes; however, intraspecific variation may weaken species-level patterns. We studied whether functional and phylogenetic diversity of Ficus species indicated the effects of spatial variation in filters associated with topography or niche partitioning related to resource use and biotic interactions. We also asked whether individual trait patterns supported species-level patterns. We studied six traits (leaf area, succulence, specific leaf area [SLA], maximum diameter breast high [dbh], fruit size, and latex exudation) for 22 Ficus species and 335 individuals {\textgreater} or = 10 cm dbh on a 20-ha forest plot in China. We found that higher elevation was correlated to changes in mean and reduced diversity of five traits, possibly due to frequent disturbances at higher elevations that favored fast-growing, poorly defended species with high SLA. Maximum dbh showed phylogenetic conservatism but high diversity among co-occurring species, suggesting adult stature is an important axis of within-quadrat niche partitioning. At the individual level, trait patterns were qualitatively consistent but were stronger than species-level patterns, especially for the leaf traits with the greatest intraspecific variation (SLA and succulence). Individual-level SLA exhibited the strongest evidence for both traits among and within-quadrat niche partitioning and indicated elevational filtering. Local niche partitioning and elevational filtering likely play an important role in maintaining species and functional diversity in the most speciose genus at our study site. Our results highlight the importance of individual variation, as it may reveal otherwise obscured niche effects.},

abstract = {For the first time the phylogenetic relationships of early eureptiles, consisting of captorhinids, diapsids, and protorothyridids, are investigated in a modern phylogenetic context using both parsimony and Bayesian approaches. Ninety parsimony-informative characters and 25 taxa were included in the analyses. The Bayesian analysis was run with and without a gamma-shape parameter allowing for variable rates across characters. In addition, we ran two more Bayesian analyses that included 42 autapomorphies and thus parsimony-uninformative characters in order to test the effect of variable branch lengths. The different analyses largely converged to the same topology, suggesting that the "protorothyridid" Coelostegus is the sister taxon of all other eureptiles and that the remaining "protorothyridids" are paraphyletic. Also, there is a close relationship between diapsids and Anthracodromeus, Cephalerpeton, and Protorothyris, a grouping of Thuringothyris with captorhinids, and a variable position of the "protorothyridids" Brouffia, Hylonomus, and Paleothyris. The lack of resolution in some parts of the tree might be due to "hard polytomies" and short divergence times between the respective taxa. The tree topology is consistent with the hypothesis that the temporal fenestrations of diapsid reptiles appear to be the consequence of a more lightly built skeleton, indicating a significant ecological shift in the early stages of diapsid evolution. Bayesian analysis is a very useful additional approach in studies of fossil taxa in which more traditional statistical support like the bootstrap is often weak. However, the exclusive use of the Mk model appears suitable only if autapomorphic characters are included, whereas the Mk+gamma model performed well with or without autapomorphies.},

abstract = {Initiatives that establish species rarity as an indicator of conservation priority might be biased if they disregard important evolutionary and adaptive processes taking place in lower diversity communities and ecotones. Conservation policies regarding the Atlantic forest strongly emphasize the core formation (i.e. the rainforest stricto sensu) rather than the marginal habitats (e.g. restingas, swamps, and high altitude campos) and species that are rare/endemic. To discuss this issue I revisit a hypothesis I have forwarded in 2002 that postulates that plant colonization of habitats marginal to the Atlantic rain forests of the State of Rio de Janeiro was largely related to terrestrial nurse plants that originally, in the rainforest habitat, were canopy plants such as epiphytes or hemi-epiphytes. Adaptations to water and nutrient restrictions, typical of life in the canopy, granted success to such plants upon migration to sandy, swampy or rocky substrates in neighbouring areas. Many such species, then, behaved as nurse plants and favoured colonization of these more extreme habitats by a number of other rainforest species. I now review recent evidence that corroborate this hypothesis, while examining the nature of such nurse plants. In all marginal habitats, nurse plants are often highly abundant locally and have high ecophysiological vigour, while both widespread and endemic species are found among them. Thus, nursing effect, local abundance, and ecophysiological performance are not related to species geographic distribution or to their spectrum of habitat preference. Paradoxically, several abundant nurse plant species have low Darwinian fitness. These studies provoke two reflections. First, the Atlantic forest sensu lato, i.e. the core formation plus the peripheral ones, should be treated collectively as a biodiversity hotspot, rather than the core rainforest formation alone. Second, widespread or common species play important functional roles in such marginal habitats and, despite their ubiquity, ecologically they might be less fit than rare/endemic ones at the local level due, for instance, to current constraints to sexual reproduction. Thus, they should also be targeted as conservation priorities. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Hymenaea stigonocarpa (Fabaceae: Caesalpinioideae) is an endemic tree from the Brazilian cerrado (savanna vegetation), a biome classified as a hotspot for conservation priority. This study investigates the phylogeographic structure of H. stigonocarpa, in order to understand the processes that have led to its current spatial genetic pattern. METHODS: The polymorphism level and spatial distribution of variants of the plastid non-coding region between the genes psbC and trnS were investigated in 175 individuals from 17 populations, covering the greater part of the total distribution of the species. Molecular diversity indices were calculated and intra-specific relationships were inferred by the construction of haplotype networks using the median-joining method. Genetic differentiation among populations and main geographical groups was evaluated using spatial analysis of molecular variance (SAMOVA). KEY RESULTS: Twenty-three different haplotypes were identified. The level of differentiation among the populations analysed was relatively high (F(ST) = 0.692). Phylogeographic analyses showed a clear association between the haplotype network and geographic distribution of populations, revealing three main geographical groups: western, central and eastern. SAMOVA corroborated this finding, indicating that most of the variation can be attributed to differences among these three groups (58.8 {\%}), with little difference among populations within groups (F(SC) = 0.252). CONCLUSIONS: The subdivision of the geographic distribution of H. stigonocarpa populations into three genetically differentiated groups can be associated with Quaternary climatic changes. The data suggest that during glacial times H. stigonocarpa populations became extinct in most parts of the southern present-day cerrado area. Milder climatic conditions in the north and eastern portions of the cerrado resulted in maintenance of populations in these regions. Thus it is inferred that the most southern part of the present-day cerrado was re-colonized by different lineages from northern parts of this biome, after postglacial climate amelioration.},

abstract = {The boreotropical flora concept suggests that relictual tropical disjunctions between Asia and the Americas are a result of the expansion of the circumboreal tropical flora from the middle to the close of the Eocene. Subsequently, temperate species diverged at high latitudes and migrated to other continents. To test this concept, we conducted a molecular phylogenetic analysis (using cpDNA) of the Magnoliaceae, a former boreotropical element that currently contains both tropical and temperate disjuncts. Divergence times of the clades were estimated using sequences of matK and two intergenic regions consisting of psbA-trnH and atpB-rbcL. Results indicate the tropical American section Talauma branched first, followed by the tropical Asian clade and the West Indies clade. Within the remaining taxa, two temperate disjunctions were formed. Assuming the temperate disjunction of Magnolia acuminata and Asian relatives occurred 25 mya (late Oligocene; based on seed fossil records), section Talauma diverged 42 mya (mid-Eocene), and tropical Asian and the West Indies clades 36 mya (late Eocene). These events correlate with cooling temperatures during the middle to late Eocene and probably caused the tropical disjunctions.},

Here, we integrated the analysis of phylobetadiversity and marked point pattern analysis to yield a new metric, the phylogenetic mark correlation function, kd(r), to quantify spatial phylogenetic structure of fully stem-mapped communities. * kd(r) is defined as the expected phylogenetic distance of two heterospecifics separated by spatial distance r, and normalized with the expected phylogenetic distance of two heterospecifics taken randomly from a study area. It measures spatial phylogenetic turnover relative to spatial species turnover and is closely related with the spatially explicit Simpson index. * We used simulated fully stem-mapped plant communities with known spatial phylogenetic structures to assess type I and II errors of the phylogenetic mark correlation function kd(r) under a null model of random phylogenetic spatial structure, and to test the ability of the kd(r) to detect scale-dependent signals of phylogenetic spatial structure. We also compared the performance of the kd(r) with two existing measures of phylobetadiversity that have been previously used to analyse fully stem-mapped plots. Finally, we explored the spatial phylogenetic structure of a 24-ha fully stem-mapped subtropical forest in China. * Simulation tests showed that the new metric yielded correct type I and type II errors and accurately detected the spatial scales at which various processes (e.g. habitat filtering and competition) were invoked to generate spatial phylogenetic structures. The power of the kd(r) was not affected by a phylogenetic signal in species abundance and different topologies of the phylogenetic tree. * Replacing phylogenetic distance by functional distance allows for application of the kd(r) to estimate spatial correlations in functional community structure. Thus, the kd(r) allows trait and phylogenetic structure to be analysed in the same framework. The phylogenetic mark correlation function is a powerful and accurate tool for revealing scale-dependent phylogenetic/functional footprints in community assemblages and allows ecologists to keep up with the increasingly available data of fully stem-mapped plots, functional traits and community phylogenies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Biology has increasingly recognized the necessity to build and utilize larger phylogenies to address broad evolutionary questions. Large phylogenies have facilitated the discovery of differential rates of molecular evolution between trees and herbs. They have helped us understand the diversification patterns of mammals as well as the patterns of seed evolution. In addition to these broad evolutionary questions there is increasing awareness of the importance of large phylogenies for addressing conservation issues such as biodiversity hotspots and response to global change. Two major classes of methods have been employed to accomplish the large tree-building task: supertrees and supermatrices. Although these methods are continually being developed, they have yet to be made fully accessible to comparative biologists making extremely large trees rare. RESULTS: Here we describe and demonstrate a modified supermatrix method termed mega-phylogeny that uses databased sequences as well as taxonomic hierarchies to make extremely large trees with denser matrices than supermatrices. The two major challenges facing large-scale supermatrix phylogenetics are assembling large data matrices from databases and reconstructing trees from those datasets. The mega-phylogeny approach addresses the former as the latter is accomplished by employing recently developed methods that have greatly reduced the run time of large phylogeny construction. We present an algorithm that requires relatively little human intervention. The implemented algorithm is demonstrated with a dataset and phylogeny for Asterales (within Campanulidae) containing 4954 species and 12,033 sites and an rbcL matrix for green plants (Viridiplantae) with 13,533 species and 1,401 sites. CONCLUSION: By examining much larger phylogenies, patterns emerge that were otherwise unseen. The phylogeny of Viridiplantae successfully reconstructs major relationships of vascular plants that previously required many more genes. These demonstrations underscore the importance of using large phylogenies to uncover important evolutionary patterns and we present a fast and simple method for constructing these phylogenies.},

However, major climatic sifting, along with responses to other factors, including soil nutrient levels, disturbance regimes, atmospheric CO2 levels, fire frequency and intensity, glaciations and the arrival of humans, have had profound impacts on the Australian vegetation, which today reflects the sum of all these factors and more.

We then identify four paradigms for metacommunities: the patch-dynamic view, the species-sorting view, the mass effects view and the neutral view, that each emphasizes different processes of potential importance in metacommunities. These have somewhat distinct intellectual histories and we discuss elements related to their potential future synthesis. We then use this framework to discuss why the concept is useful in modifying existing ecological thinking and illustrate this with a number of both theoretical and empirical examples. As ecologists strive to understand increasingly complex mechanisms and strive to work across multiple scales of spatio-temporal organization, concepts like the metacommunity can provide important insights that frequently contrast with those that would be obtained with more conventional approaches based on local communities alone.},

Six species are repeatedly $\backslash$ndominant throughout the entire sampling area. There was homogeneity in relation to diversity and species richness between $\backslash$nbeach ridges but not within beach ridges. Floristic composition and structural parameters did not vary in relation to distance $\backslash$nfrom the sea but floristic composition did vary as a function of proximity to Cabi{\'{u}}nas or Comprida lagoon. Differences in plant $\backslash$ncover between sample areas may be related to the paleoformation of this sandy coastal plain.},

abstract = {Pines comprise one of the largest coniferous genera, are distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere, and have an abundant fossil record. Distributions of fossils have been used to derive a three-step hypothesis of early pine evolution, which postulates a Mesozoic origin for the genus, east-west expansions across Laurasia, and retraction into Eocene refugia. Here, we present phylogenetic tests of this hypothesis using chloroplast sequence data from four loci for 83 pine species. We used the fossil-based hypothesis to derive null expectations concerning monophyly of taxonomic groups, dates of cladogenesis, and patterns of diversification. Phylogenetic analyses using several algorithms subsequently provided rigorous tests of these expectations. Our inferred phylogenies illustrated broad congruence with taxonomic groups, but highlighted consistent problems within subgenus Strobus. Estimated minimum dates of divergence derived from relaxed clock methods were largely consistent with the fossil record and yielded a date for the ingroup node of Pinus of 128 ± 4 mya, depending upon the calibration used for subgenus Pinus. Ancestral area reconstructions showed Pinus to have most likely originated in Eurasia. Major clades differed in biogeographic patterns, but were consistent with the fossil-based hypothesis. We found weak support, however, for a change in diversification rate in the Eocene as interpretations of fossil distributions would have predicted. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The paradox of biodiversity involves three elements, (i) mathematical models predict that species must differ in specific ways in order to coexist as stable ecological communities, (ii) such differences are difficult to identify, yet (iii) there is widespread evidence of stability in natural communities. Debate has centred on two views. The first explanation involves tradeoffs along a small number of axes, including 'colonization-competition', resource competition (light, water, nitrogen for plants, including the 'successional niche'), and life history (e.g. high-light growth vs. low-light survival and few large vs. many small seeds). The second view is neutrality, which assumes that species differences do not contribute to dynamics. Clark et al. (2004) presented a third explanation, that coexistence is inherently high dimensional, but still depends on species differences. We demonstrate that neither traditional low-dimensional tradeoffs nor neutrality can resolve the biodiversity paradox, in part by showing that they do not properly interpret stochasticity in statistical and in theoretical models. Unless sample sizes are small, traditional data modelling assures that species will appear different in a few dimensions, but those differences will rarely predict coexistence when parameter estimates are plugged into theoretical models. Contrary to standard interpretations, neutral models do not imply functional equivalence, but rather subsume species differences in stochastic terms. New hierarchical modelling techniques for inference reveal high-dimensional differences among species that can be quantified with random individual and temporal effects (RITES), i.e. process-level variation that results from many causes. We show that this variation is large, and that it stands in for species differences along unobserved dimensions that do contribute to diversity. High dimensional coexistence contrasts with the classical notions of tradeoffs along a few axes, which are often not found in data, and with 'neutral models', which mask, rather than eliminate, tradeoffs in stochastic terms. This mechanism can explain coexistence of species that would not occur with simple, low-dimensional tradeoff scenarios.},

abstract = {The Lonicera clade Caprifolium contains approximately 25 species distributed around the Northern Hemisphere, including in the Mediterranean climates of California and Europe. We sequenced the second intron of LFY to help resolve relationships within the clade where the internal transcribed spacer and chloroplast markers had previously failed to do so. Divergence time estimation and biogeographic analyses over the posterior distribution of dated trees suggest that a widespread ancestor was distributed across the Northern Hemisphere some 7-17 million years ago. Asian species form a sister group to a clade in which the European species are sister to the North American species. We use climatic niche modeling and divergence time estimates to explore the evolution of climate variables in the group. Principal component analyses help to identify instances of convergence, especially between distantly related species in the Mediterranean basin and in the chaparral of California. We document several cases of significant divergence between sister species in eastern North America and western North America. Climatic models were projected from one continent into the others (e.g., North American species projected into Asia and Europe) to examine whether species living in these areas occupy similar climates. This study demonstrates the utility of combining niche modeling with historical biogeographic analyses and documents significant climatic niche evolution within a group of species distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere. These results suggest a possible model for the origin of the Madrean-Tethyan disjunction pattern.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The oriental forest ecosystem in Madagascar has been seriously impacted by fragmentation. The pattern of genetic diversity was analysed on a tree species, Dalbergia monticola, which plays an important economic role in Madagascar and is one of the many endangered tree species in the eastern forest. METHODS: Leaves from 546 individuals belonging to 18 small populations affected by different levels of fragmentation were genotyped using eight nuclear (nuc) and three chloroplast (cp) microsatellite markers. KEY RESULTS: For nuclear microsatellites, allelic richness (R) and heterozygosity (H(e,nuc)) differed between types of forest: R = 7.36 and R = 9.55, H(e,nuc) = 0.64 and H(e,nuc) = 0.80 in fragmented and non-fragmented forest, respectively, but the differences were not significant. Only the mean number of alleles (N(a,nuc)) and the fixation index F(IS) differed significantly: N(a,nuc) = 9.41 and N(a,nuc) = 13.18, F(IS) = 0.06 and F(IS) = 0.15 in fragmented and non-fragmented forests, respectively. For chloroplast microsatellites, estimated genetic diversity was higher in non-fragmented forest, but the difference was not significant. No recent bottleneck effect was detected for either population. Overall differentiation was low for nuclear microsatellites (F(ST,nuc) = 0.08) and moderate for chloroplast microsatellites (F(ST,cp) = 0.49). A clear relationship was observed between genetic and geographic distance (r = 0.42 P {\textless} 0.01 and r = 0.42 P = 0.03 for nuclear and chloroplast microsatellites, respectively), suggesting a pattern of isolation by distance. Analysis of population structure using the neighbor-joining method or Bayesian models separated southern populations from central and northern populations with nuclear microsatellites, and grouped the population according to regions with chloroplast microsatellites, but did not separate the fragmented populations. CONCLUSIONS: Residual diversity and genetic structure of populations of D. monticola in Madagascar suggest a limited impact of fragmentation on molecular genetic parameters.},

abstract = {The genetic differentiation of populations is a key parameter in population genetic investigations. Wright's F(ST) (and its relatives such as G(ST) ) has been a standard measure of differentiation. However, the deficiencies of these indexes have been increasingly realized in recent years, leading to some new measures being proposed, such as Jost's D (Molecular Ecology, 2008; 17, 4015). The existence of these new metrics has stimulated considerable debate and induced some confusion on which statistics should be used for estimating population differentiation. Here, we report a simulation study with neutral microsatellite DNA loci under a finite island model to compare the performance of G(ST) and D, particularly under nonequilibrium conditions. Our results suggest that there exist fundamental differences between the two statistics, and neither G(ST) nor D operates satisfactorily in all situations for quantifying differentiation. D is very sensitive to mutation models but G(ST) noticeably less so, which limits D's utility in population parameter estimation and comparisons across genetic markers. Also, the initial heterozygosity of the starting populations has some important effects on both the individual behaviours of G(ST) and D and their relative behaviours in early differentiation, and this effect is much greater for D than G(ST) . In the early stages of differentiation, when initial heterozygosity is relatively low ({\textless}0.5, if the number of subpopulations is large), G(ST) increases faster than D; the opposite is true when initial heterozygosity is high. Therefore, the state of the ancestral population appears to have some lasting impacts on population differentiation. In general, G(ST) can measure differentiation fairly well when heterozygosity is low whatever the causes; however, when heterozygosity is high (e.g. as a result of either high mutation rate or high initial heterozygosity) and gene flow is moderate to strong, G(ST) fails to measure differentiation. Interestingly, when population size is not very small (e.g. N ≥ 1000), G(ST) measures differentiation quite linearly with time over a long duration when gene flow is absent or very weak even if mutation rate is not low (e.g. $\mu$ = 0.001). In contrast, D, as a differentiation measure, performs rather robustly in all these situations. In practice, both indexes should be calculated and the relative levels of heterozygosities (especially H(S) ) and gene flow taken into account. We suggest that a comparison of the two indexes can generate useful insights into the evolutionary processes that influence population differentiation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The genus Olea (Oleaceae) includes approx. 40 taxa of evergreen shrubs and trees classified in three subgenera, Olea, Paniculatae and Tetrapilus, the first of which has two sections (Olea and Ligustroides). Olive trees (the O. europaea complex) have been the subject of intensive research, whereas little is known about the phylogenetic relationships among the other species. To clarify the biogeographical history of this group, a molecular analysis of Olea and related genera of Oleaceae is thus necessary. METHODS: A phylogeny was built of Olea and related genera based on sequences of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer-1 and four plastid regions. Lineage divergence and the evolution of abaxial peltate scales, the latter character linked to drought adaptation, were dated using a Bayesian method. KEY RESULTS: Olea is polyphyletic, with O. ambrensis and subgenus Tetrapilus not sharing a most recent common ancestor with the main Olea clade. Partial incongruence between nuclear and plastid phylogenetic reconstructions suggests a reticulation process in the evolution of subgenus Olea. Estimates of divergence times for major groups of Olea during the Tertiary were obtained. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates the necessity of revising current taxonomic boundaries in Olea. The results also suggest that main lines of evolution were promoted by major Tertiary climatic shifts: (1) the split between subgenera Olea and Paniculatae appears to have taken place at the Miocene-Oligocene boundary; (2) the separation of sections Ligustroides and Olea may have occurred during the Early Miocene following the Mi-1 glaciation; and (3) the diversification within these sections (and the origin of dense abaxial indumentum in section Olea) was concomitant with the aridification of Africa in the Late Miocene.},

abstract = {Interpopulation gene flow in plants is mediated by a combination of pollen and seed dispersal. The effectiveness of pollen and seeds in bringing about gene flow depends upon the mode of inheritance of the genetic marker. For nuclear and paternally inherited markers, gene flow occurs in both pollen and seed. For maternally inherited markers, genes are only dispersed in seeds. As a result, levels of population differentiation under drift-migration equilibrium are expected to differ for markers with contrasting modes of inheritance, and the extent of such differences should be related to the relative levels of pollen and seed migration among populations. A model is developed that relates expected values of population differentiation (F,) for nuclear, paternally and maternally inherited markers, to pollen and seed migration rates. The model is used to estimate the relative rates of seed and pollen flow in six species of plants where values are available for both nuclear and maternally inherited markers. Estimates of (pollen flow/seed flow) range from four in wild barley to 200 in oaks, and this pattern of variation is consistent with the reproductive characteristics of the species concerned},

Phylogenetic relationships of the genus Ilex were investigated using the plastid psbA-trnH intergenic spacer and parsimony and Bayesian analyses. The psbA-trnH intergenic spacer was shown to evolve slowly within Ilex, but a major gap present in this region was useful in the phylogenetic study of the genus. To obtain more potentially parsimonious characters, atpB-rbcL intergenic spacer data were combined with those for psbA-trnH. Many gaps present in the psbA-trnH region were useful in the phylogenetic study of the genus Ilex.

abstract = {The outcome of competitive interactions is likely to be influenced by both competitive dominance (i.e. niche-based dynamics) and ecological drift (i.e. neutral dynamics governed by demographic stochasticity). However, spatial models of competition rarely consider the joint operation of these two processes. We develop a model based on the original competition-colonization trade-off model that incorporates niche and neutral processes and several realistic facets of ecological dynamics: it allows local competition (i.e. competition within a patch) to occur within communities of a finite size, it allows competitors to vary in the degree of competitive asymmetry, and it includes the role of local migration (i.e. propagule pressure). The model highlights the role of community size, i.e. the number of competitors in the local community, in mediating the relative importance of stochastic and deterministic forces. In metacommunities where local communities are small, ecological drift is substantial enough that strong competitors become effectively neutral, creating abrupt changes in the outcome of competition not predicted by the standard competition-colonization trade-off. Importantly, the model illustrates that, even when other aspects of species interactions (e.g. migration ability, competitive ability) are unchanged, local community size can alter the dynamics of metacommunity persistence. Our work demonstrates that activities which reduce the size of local communities, such as habitat destruction and degradation, effectively compound the extinction debt.},

abstract = {Growing evidence of morphological diversity in angiosperm flowers, seeds and pollen from the mid Cretaceous and the presence of derived lineages from increasingly older geological deposits both imply that the timing of early angiosperm cladogenesis is older than fossil-based estimates have indicated. An alternative to fossils for calibrating the phylogeny comes from divergence in DNA sequence data. Here, angiosperm divergence times are estimated using non-parametric rate smoothing and a three-gene dataset covering ca. 75{\%} of all angiosperm families recognized in recent classifications. The results provide an initial hypothesis of angiosperm diversification times. Using an internal calibration point, an independent evaluation of angiosperm and eudicot origins is performed. The origin of the crown group of extant angiosperms is indicated to be Early to Middle Jurassic (179-158 Myr), and the origin of eudicots is resolved as Late Jurassic to mid Cretaceous (147-131 Myr). Both estimates, despite a conservative calibration point, are older than current fossil-based estimates.},

abstract = {1. Understanding how species in a diverse regional pool are spatially distributed with respect to habitat types is a longstanding problem in ecology. Tropical species are expected to be specialists along environmental gradients, and this should result in rapid compositional change (high beta diversity) across landscapes, particularly when alpha diversity is a small fraction of regional diversity. Corollary challenges are then to identify controlling environmental variables and to ask whether species cluster into discrete community types along a gradient. 2. We investigated patterns of avian species' distributions in the Tilar{\'{a}}n mountains of Costa Rica between 1000 m and 1700 m elevation where a strong moisture gradient exists. High beta diversity was found with both auditory counts adjusted for detectability and extensive capture data, revealing nearly complete change in community composition over a few kilometres on the Pacific slope. As predicted, this beta diversity was roughly twice as high as on temperate mountainsides. 3. Partial Mantel analyses and canonical correspondence analysis indicate that change in species composition is highly correlated with change in moisture (and correlated epiphyte cover) at different distances from the continental divide on the Pacific slope. Altitude was not a good predictor of change in species composition, as species composition varies substantially among sites at the same elevation. 4. Detrended correspondence analysis and cluster analysis revealed a zone of rapid transition separating a distinct cloud forest community from rainshadow forest. On the Caribbean slope, where a shallower moisture gradient was predicted to result in lower beta diversity, we found lower rates of compositional change and more continuous species turnover. 5. Results suggest that habitat specialization of birds is likely a strong ecological force generating high beta diversity in montane landscapes. Despite overall rapid rates of species turnover, zones of relatively coherent composition could be identified. 6. Landscapes with such high beta diversity are common in the tropics, although little studied. They offer high benefit/cost opportunities for conservation, particularly as climate change threatens to alter the species composition of communities of habitat specialists.},

abstract = {Populations can be genetically isolated both by geographic distance and by differences in their ecology or environment that decrease the rate of successful migration. Empirical studies often seek to investigate the relationship between genetic differentiation and some ecological variable(s) while accounting for geographic distance, but common approaches to this problem (such as the partial Mantel test) have a number of drawbacks. In this article, we present a Bayesian method that enables users to quantify the relative contributions of geographic distance and ecological distance to genetic differentiation between sampled populations or individuals. We model the allele frequencies in a set of populations at a set of unlinked loci as spatially correlated Gaussian processes, in which the covariance structure is a decreasing function of both geographic and ecological distance. Parameters of the model are estimated using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We call this method Bayesian Estimation of Differentiation in Alleles by Spatial Structure and Local Ecology (BEDASSLE), and have implemented it in a user-friendly format in the statistical platform R. We demonstrate its utility with a simulation study and empirical applications to human and teosinte data sets.},

abstract = {Biological invasions may expose populations to strong selection for local adaptation along geographical gradients in climate. However, evolution during contemporary timescales can be constrained by low standing genetic variation and genetic correlations among life-history traits. We examined limits to local adaptation associated with northern migration of the invasive wetland plant purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) using a selection model incorporating a trade-off between flowering time and size at reproduction, and common garden experiments of populations sampled along a latitudinal transect of approximately 1200 km in eastern North America. A strong trade-off between flowering time and size at reproduction caused early-flowering plants to be smaller with reduced seed production in northern populations. Northward spread was associated with a decline in genetic variance within populations and an increase in genetic skew for flowering time and size, with limited genetic variation for small, early-flowering genotypes. These patterns were predicted by our selection model of local adaptation to shorter growing seasons and were not consistent with expectations from non-adaptive processes. Reduced fecundity may limit population growth and rates of spread in northern populations. Identifying genetic constraints on key life-history traits can provide novel insights into invasion dynamics and the causes of range limits in introduced species. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Inselbergs occur as mostly dome-shaped rock outcrops in all climatic and vegetational zones of the tropics. Consisting of Precambrian granites and gneisses, they form ancient and stable landscape elements. Due to harsh edaphic and microclimatic conditions, the vegetation of inselbergs differs markedly from those of the surroundings. Monocotyledonous mats form one of the most characteristic communities of this ecosystem. The floristic composition of this community was studied on six inselbergs located in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest. Dominating are Bromeliaceae (Alcantarea, Encholirium), Velloziaceae (Vellozia), Cactaceae (Coleocephalocereus) and the Cyperaceae Trilepis. The alpha diversity of the mats was relatively uniform among the six outcrops. However, beta diversity varied considerably between the different sites. Beta diversity was highest at the most speciose locality indicating a high degree of stochasticity in colonization. In contrast to the low diversity mats on West African inselbergs, the Brazilian rock outcrops bear a floristically more diverse mat community rich in endemics. Thus the edaphically controlled inselberg vegetation reflects the outstanding diversity of the Mata Atla{\^{a}}ntica. Possibly the high species richness of mats on East Brazilian inselbergs is a consequence of a large species-pool. The processes that regulate regional and local diversity in the Mata Atla{\^{a}}ntica are not fully clear. It is assumed that historical (i.e. long-term stability) and biotic (i.e. evolutionary interchange of taxa between canopies and rock outcrops followed by differentiation of local populations) conditions have promoted high rates of speciation and their coexistence in isolated habitats. A danger to the unique vegetation of East Brazilian inselbergs is the establishment of invasive weeds.},

abstract = {A widely assumed but largely untested hypothesis central to ecology and evolutionary biology has been Charles Darwin's suggestion that closely related species will be more ecologically similar, and thus will compete more strongly with each other than they will with more distantly related species. We provide one of the first direct tests of the "competition-relatedness hypothesis" by combining two data sets: the relative competitive ability of 50 vascular plant species competing against 92 competitor species measured in five multi-species experiments, and measures of the phylogenetic relatedness of these species. In contrast to Darwin's assertion, there were weak relationships between the strength of competition and phylogenetic relatedness. Across all species studied, the competition-relatedness relationship was weak and not significant. This overall lack of pattern masked different responses of monocot and eudicot focal (phytometer) species. When monocots served as the focal (phytometer) species, the intensity of competition increased with the phylogenetic distance separating species, while competition decreased with phylogenetic distance for eudicot phytometers. These results were driven by the monocot-eudicot evolutionary split, such that monocots were poor competitors against eudicots, while eudicots are most strongly suppressed by other eudicots. There was no relationship between relatedness and competition for eudicots competing with other eudicots, while monocots did compete more intensely with closely related monocots than with distantly related monocots. Overall, the relationships between competition intensity and relatedness were weak compared to the strong and consistent relationships between competitive ability and functional traits such as plant size that have been reported by other studies. We suggest that Darwin's assertion that competition will be strongest among closely related species is not supported by empirical data, at least for the 142 vascular plant species in this study. {\textcopyright} 2007 R{\"{u}}bel Foundation, ETH Z{\"{u}}rich.},

We use a bromeliad phylogeny based on eight plastid regions to analyze relationships within the family, test a new, eight-subfamily classification, infer the chronology of bromeliad evolution and invasion of different regions, and provide the basis for future analyses of trait evolution and rates of diversification.• Methods: We employed maximum-parsimony, maximum-likelihood, and Bayesian approaches to analyze 9341 aligned bases for four outgroups and 90 bromeliad species representing 46 of 58 described genera. We calibrate the resulting phylogeny against time using penalized likelihood applied to a monocot-wide tree based on plastid ndhF sequences and use it to analyze patterns of geographic spread using parsimony, Bayesian inference, and the program S-DIVA.• Results: Bromeliad subfamilies are related to each other as follows: (Brocchinioideae, (Lindmanioideae, (Tillandsioideae, (Hechtioideae, (Navioideae, (Pitcairnioideae, (Puyoideae, Bromelioideae))))))). Bromeliads arose in the Guayana Shield ca. 100 million years ago (Ma), spread centrifugally in the New World beginning ca. 16–13 Ma, and dispersed to West Africa ca. 9.3 Ma. Modern lineages began to diverge from each other roughly 19 Ma.• Conclusions: Nearly two-thirds of extant bromeliads belong to two large radiations: the core tillandsioids, originating in the Andes ca. 14.2 Ma, and the Brazilian Shield bromelioids, originating in the Serro do Mar and adjacent regions ca. 9.1 Ma.},

They also proposed a mixture model, which was inconsistent but better than either parsimony or standard likelihood under heterotachy. We show that their main conclusion is limited to a special case for the type of model they study. Their mixture model was inconsistent because it was incorrectly implemented.

abstract = {Since Darwin published the "Origin," great progress has been made in our understanding of speciation mechanisms. The early investigations by Mayr and Dobzhansky linked Darwin's view of speciation by adaptive divergence to the evolution of reproductive isolation, and thus provided a framework for studying the origin of species. However, major controversies and questions remain, including: When is speciation nonecological? Under what conditions does geographic isolation constitute a reproductive isolating barrier? and How do we estimate the "importance" of different isolating barriers? Here, we address these questions, providing historical background and offering some new perspectives. A topic of great recent interest is the role of ecology in speciation. "Ecological speciation" is defined as the case in which divergent selection leads to reproductive isolation, with speciation under uniform selection, polyploid speciation, and speciation by genetic drift defined as "nonecological." We review these proposed cases of nonecological speciation and conclude that speciation by uniform selection and polyploidy normally involve ecological processes. Furthermore, because selection can impart reproductive isolation both directly through traits under selection and indirectly through pleiotropy and linkage, it is much more effective in producing isolation than genetic drift. We thus argue that natural selection is a ubiquitous part of speciation, and given the many ways in which stochastic and deterministic factors may interact during divergence, we question whether the ecological speciation concept is useful. We also suggest that geographic isolation caused by adaptation to different habitats plays a major, and largely neglected, role in speciation. We thus provide a framework for incorporating geographic isolation into the biological species concept (BSC) by separating ecological from historical processes that govern species distributions, allowing for an estimate of geographic isolation based upon genetic differences between taxa. Finally, we suggest that the individual and relative contributions of all potential barriers be estimated for species pairs that have recently achieved species status under the criteria of the BSC. Only in this way will it be possible to distinguish those barriers that have actually contributed to speciation from those that have accumulated after speciation is complete. We conclude that ecological adaptation is the major driver of reproductive isolation, and that the term "biology of speciation," as proposed by Mayr, remains an accurate and useful characterization of the diversity of speciation mechanisms.},

abstract = {Based on data obtained from the system MoZMaD - PL (Polish Mother and Child Health Monitoring System; an equivalent of the American system PRAMS (Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System). In the developed countries prevention programmes proved to be efficient in reducing morbidity and mortality due to breast and cervical cancer. In Poland, these diseases still constitute a very big problem, despite relatively easy and early diagnostics of pathological conditions preceding their development. The objective of the study was analysis of the usage of prophylactic examinations and the assessment of knowledge concerning risk factors of the development of reproductive cancers among pregnant women from rural and urban environments in Poland. The study was based on questionnaire forms within the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (MoZMaD - PL) implemented in Poland. The precise date of the study for the whole of Poland is announced annually by the Chief Sanitary Inspector. The questionnaire forms were correctly completed in 2010 by 2,877 women. The replies to the questions were introduced by surveyors into the MoZMaD - PL system central database managed by the Institute of Agricultural Medicine in Lublin. The results obtained were subjected to statistical analysis. The studies of pregnant women in Poland showed that the situation with respect to the performance of prevention examinations for cervical cancer was significantly worse among rural than urban women. Pregnant women from both rural and urban areas very rarely had breast USG performed. Awareness concerning cervical cancer risk factors was lower among rural than urban women. Also, knowledge concerning the examinations which should be performed for the prevention of breast cancer was poorer among rural, compared to urban women. The recognition of the attitudes of women at reproductive age towards prevention examinations is necessary in order to effectively plan health education and social health promotion campaigns aimed at limiting morbidity and mortality due to cancerous diseases.},

abstract = {I. II. III. IV. V. VI. VII. VIII. References Summary Climate change exposes vegetation to unusual drought, causing declines in productivity and increased mortality. Drought responses are hard to anticipate because canopy transpiration and diffusive conductance (G) respond to drying soil and vapor pressure deficit (D) in complex ways. A growing database of hydraulic traits, combined with a parsimonious theory of tree water transport and its regulation, may improve predictions of at-risk vegetation. The theory uses the physics of flow through soil and xylem to quantify how canopy water supply declines with drought and ceases by hydraulic failure. This transpiration ‘supply function' is used to predict a water ‘loss function' by assuming that stomatal regulation exploits transport capacity while avoiding failure. Supply–loss theory incorporates root distribution, hydraulic redistribution, cavitation vulnerability, and cavitation reversal. The theory efficiently defines stomatal responses to D, drying soil, and hydraulic vulnerability. Driving the theory with climate predicts drought-induced loss of plant hydraulic conductance (k), canopy G, carbon assimilation, and productivity. Data lead to the ‘chronic stress hypothesis' wherein {\textgreater} 60{\%} loss of k increases mortality by multiple mechanisms. Supply–loss theory predicts the climatic conditions that push vegetation over this risk threshold. The theory's simplicity and predictive power encourage testing and application in large-scale modeling.},

@article{Davies2004,
abstract = {One of the most pervasive patterns observed in biodiversity studies is the tendency for species richness to decline towards the poles. One possible explanation is that high levels of environmental energy promote higher species richness nearer the equator. Energy input may set a limit to the number of species that can coexist in an area or alternatively may influence evolutionary rates. Within flowering plants (angiosperms), families exposed to a high energy load tend to be both more species rich and possess faster evolutionary rates, although there is no evidence that one drives the other. Specific environmental effects are likely to vary among lineages, reflecting the interaction between biological traits and environmental conditions in which they are found. One example of this is demonstrated by the high species richness of the iris family (Iridaceae) in the Cape of South Africa, a likely product of biological traits associated with reproductive isolation and the steep ecological and climatic gradients of the region. Within any set of conditions some lineages will tend to be favoured over others; however, the identity of these lineages will fluctuate with a changing environment, explaining the highly labile nature of diversification rates observed among major lineages of flowering plants.},

abstract = {Most studies of plant community assembly have focused on how the abiotic aspects of a habitat (e.g. soil moisture or mineral composition) or direct interactions among plants in a community (e.g. competition for space or nutrients) influence which species establish and persist, but they have tended to neglect indirect interactions such as those mediated by pollinators. We address three types of plant-pollinator interactions - filtering, facilitation and competitive exclusion - and their predicted impacts on communities. The few available studies that address how pollinator-mediated interactions limit or promote plant species establishment and persistence provide support for many of these predictions. An integrated framework for understanding plant community assembly needs to incorporate abiotic and biotic interactions, including plant-pollinator and other plant-animal interactions. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This review summarizes the research on physiological responses to flooding of trees in the seasonal black-water wetland of the Mapire River in Venezuela. Inter-annual variability was found during 8 years of sampling, in spite of which a general picture emerged of increased stomatal conductance (gs) and photosynthetic rate (PN) during the flooded period to values as high as or higher than in plants in drained wet soil. Models explaining the initial inhibitory responses and the acclimation to flooding are proposed. In the inhibitory phase of flooding, hypoxia generated by flooding causes a decrease in root water absorption and stomatal closure. An increase with flooding in xylem water potential ($\psi$) suggests that flooding does not cause water deficit. The PN decreases due to changes in relative stomatal and non-stomatal limitations to photosynthesis; an increase in the latter is due to reduced chlorophyll and total soluble protein content. Total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC) accumulate in leaves but their content begins to decrease during the acclimatized phase at full flooding, coinciding with the resumption of high gs and PN. The reversal of the diminution in gs is associated, in some but not all species, to the growth of adventitious roots. The occurrence of morpho-anatomical and biochemical adaptations which improve oxygen supply would cause the acclimation, including increased water absorption by the roots, increased rubisco and chlorophyll contents and ultimately increased PN. Therefore, trees would perform as if flooding did not signify a stress to their physiology.},

abstract = {While the fundamental trade-off in leaf traits related to carbon capture as described by the leaf economics spectrum is well-established among plant species, the relationship of the leaf economics spectrum to stem hydraulics is much less known. Since carbon capture and transpiration are coupled, a close connection between leaf traits and stem hydraulics should be expected. We thus asked whether xylem traits that describe drought tolerance and vulnerability to cavitation are linked to particular leaf traits. We assessed xylem vulnerability, using the pressure sleeve technique, and anatomical xylem characteristics in 39 subtropical tree species grown under common garden conditions in the BEF-China experiment and tested for correlations with traits related to the leaf economics spectrum as well as to stomatal control, including maximum stomatal conductance, vapor pressure deficit at maximum stomatal conductance and vapor pressure deficit at which stomatal conductance is down-regulated. Our results revealed that specific xylem hydraulic conductivity and cavitation resistance were closely linked to traits represented in the leaf economic spectrum, in particular to leaf nitrogen concentration, as well as to log leaf area and leaf carbon to nitrogen ratio but not to any parameter of stomatal conductance. The study highlights the potential use of well-known leaf traits from the leaf economics spectrum to predict plant species' drought resistance.},

abstract = {Seasonally dry tropical forests exhibit a markedly discontinuous, disjunct distribution pattern across South America. Previous botanical inventories have revealed that these dry forest areas exhibit close floristic links with one another, which has led to the hypothesis that they constitute mod- ern-day refugia, resulting from vicariance (i.e. fragmentation) of a formerly more widespread, contin- uous distribution during more arid climatic conditions associated with the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). This paper examines the validity of this ‘dry forest refugia' hypothesis in the light of previously published fossil pollen data and vegetation model simulations. The model simulations suggest that major dry forest areas, such as the Bolivian Chiquitano Dry Forest, are not Pleistocene refugia, but instead developed during the Holocene by population expansions from parts of southern Amazonia presently covered by evergreen rainforest. The limited pollen data available indicate that glacial-age seasonally dry tropical forests, irrespective of their distribution, were floristically quite different from those of today, with key dry forest species, such as Anadenanthera, only appearing in the Holocene. I suggest that a more parsimonious explanation for the current biogeographic pattern of these South American dry forests is population migration (perhaps by long-distance dispersal) since the LGM, rather than vicariance.},

abstract = {In Pinaceae, the chloroplast, mitochondrial, and nuclear genomes are paternally, maternally, and biparentally inherited, respectively. Examining congruence and incongruence of gene phylogenies among the three genomes should provide insights into phylogenetic relationships within the family. Here we studied intergeneric relationships of Pinaceae using sequences of the chloroplast matK gene, the mitochondrial nad5 gene, and the low-copy nuclear gene 4CL. The 4CL gene may exist as a single copy in some species of Pinaceae, but it constitutes a small gene family with two or three members in others. Duplication and deletion of the 4CL gene occurred at a tempo such that paralogous loci are maintained within but not between genera. Exons of the 4CL gene have diverged approximately twice as fast as the matK gene and five times more rapidly than the nad5 gene. The partition-homogeneity test indicates that the three data sets are homogeneous. A combined analysis of the three gene sequences generated a well-resolved and strongly supported phylogeny. The combined phylogeny, which is topologically congruent with the three individual gene trees based on the Templeton test, is likely to represent the organismal phylogeny of Pinaceae. This phylogeny agrees to a certain extent with previous phylogenetic hypotheses based on morphological, anatomical, and immunological data. Disagreement between the previous hypotheses and the three-genome phylogeny suggests that morphology of both vegetative and reproductive organs has undergone convergent evolution within the pine family. The strongly supported monophyly of Nothotsuga longibracteata, Tsuga mertensiana, and Tsuga canadensis on all three gene phylogenies provides evidence against previous hypotheses of intergeneric hybrid origins of N. longibracteata and T. mertensiana. Divergence times of the genera were estimated based on sequence divergence of the matK gene, and they correspond well with the fossil record.},

In this study, we test vicariance hypotheses for range disjunctions in the rainforest tree Ceiba pentandra, which is naturally widespread across equatorial Africa and the Neotropics. Approximate molecular clocks were applied to nuclear ribosomal [ITS (internal transcribed spacer)] and chloroplast (psbB-psbF) spacer DNA sampled from 12 Neotropical and five West African populations. The ITS (N=5) and psbB-psbF (N=2) haplotypes exhibited few nucleotide differences, and ITS and psbB-psbF haplotypes were shared by populations on both continents. The low levels of nucleotide divergence falsify vicariance explanations for transatlantic and cross-Andean range disjunctions. The study shows how extreme long-distance dispersal, via wind or marine currents, creates taxonomic similarities in the plant communities of Africa and the Neotropics.},

Next we show that, for trees generated under the Yule model, the approximate position of the root can be estimated from the associated unrooted tree, even for trees with a large number of leaves.

abstract = {Comparative methods analyses have usually assumed that the species phenotypes are the true means for those species. In most analyses, the actual values used are means of samples of modest size. The covariances of contrasts then involve both the covariance of evolutionary changes and a fraction of the within-species phenotypic covariance, the fraction depending on the sample size for that species. Ives et al. have shown how to analyze data in this case when the within-species phenotypic covariances are known. The present model allows them to be unknown and to be estimated from the data. A multivariate normal statistical model is used for multiple characters in samples of finite size from species related by a known phylogeny, under the usual Brownian motion model of change and with equal within-species phenotypic covariances. Contrasts in each character can be obtained both between individuals within a species and between species. Each contrast can be taken for all of the characters. These sets of contrasts, each the same contrast taken for different characters, are independent. The within-set covariances are unequal and depend on the unknown true covariance matrices. An expectation-maximization algorithm is derived for making a reduced maximum likelihood estimate of the covariances of evolutionary change and the within-species phenotypic covariances. It is available in the Contrast program of the PHYLIP package. Computer simulations show that the covariances are biased when the finiteness of sample size is not taken into account and that using the present model corrects the bias. Sampling variation reduces the power of inference of covariation in evolution of different characters. An extension of this method to incorporate estimates of additive genetic covariances from a simple genetic experiment is also discussed.},

abstract = {Te succulent life form is a tried and true strategy for plants living in arid envi- ronments. It has evolved in many distantly related lineages comprising 12,500 species from 70 flowering plant families and has spawned remarkable radiations. Tree major groups are generally recognized: (1) stem succulents (that is, leafless cactus-like growth forms), (2) leaf succulents, and (3) caudiciform and pachycaul succulents. All three lifeform groups are rep- resented in the relatively small suborder Portulacineae. Here we suggest that this diversity provides a unique opportunity to evaluate early cactus evolution within a richer contextual framework. We briefly review what we know about the phylogenetic relationships within the suborder Portulacineae (that is, Basellaceae, Cactaceae, Didiereaceae, and Portulacaceae) and the morphology and ecology of all major Portulacineae lineages. We then outline what we believe to be key areas for future research on these understudied plants and discuss several hypothetical “pre-adaptations” and conditions in ancestral Portulacineae that may have pro- moted the repeated evolution of unusual succulent life forms.},

abstract = {After 500 years of exploitation and destruction, the Brazilian Atlantic Forest has been reduced to less the 8{\%} of its original cover, and climate change may pose a new threat to the remnants of this biodiversity hotspot. In this study we used modelling techniques to determine present and future geographical distribution of 38 species of trees that are typical of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (Mata Atl{\^{a}}ntica), considering two global warming scenarios. The optimistic scenario, based in a 0.5{\%} increase in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, predicts an increase of up to 2 °C in the Earth's average temperature; in the pessimistic scenario, based on a 1{\%} increase in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, temperature increase may reach 4 °C. Using these parameters, the occurrence points of the studied species registered in literature, the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Predictions/GARP and Maximum entropy modeling of species geographic distributions/MaxEnt we developed models of present and future possible occurrence of each species, considering Earth's mean temperature by 2050 with the optimistic and the pessimistic scenarios of CO2 emission. The results obtained show an alarming reduction in the area of possible occurrence of the species studied, as well as a shift towards southern areas of Brazil. Using GARP, on average, in the optimistic scenario this reduction is of 25{\%} while in the pessimistic scenario it reaches 50{\%}, and the species that will suffer the worst reduction in their possible area of occurrence are: Euterpe edulis, Mollinedia schottiana, Virola bicuhyba, Inga sessilis and Vochysia magnifica. Using MaxEnt, on average, in the optimistic scenario the reduction will be of 20{\%} while in the pessimistic scenario it reaches 30{\%}, and the species that will suffer the worst reduction are: Hyeronima alchorneoides, Schefflera angustissima, Andira fraxinifolia and the species of Myrtaceae studied.},

abstract = {For populations having dispersal described by fat-tailed kernels (kernels with tails that are not exponentially bounded), asymptotic population spread rates cannot be estimated by traditional models because these models predict continually accelerating (asymptotically infinite) invasion. The impossible predictions come from the fact that the fat-tailed kernels fitted to dispersal data have a quality (nondiscrete individuals and, thus, no moment-generating function) that never applies to data. Real organisms produce finite (and random) numbers of offspring; thus, an empirical moment-generating function can always be determined. Using an alternative method to estimate spread rates in terms of extreme dispersal events, we show that finite estimates can be derived for fat-tailed kernels, and we demonstrate how variable reproduction modifies these rates. Whereas the traditional models define spread rate as the speed of an advancing front describing the expected density of individuals, our alternative definition for spread rate is the expected velocity for the location of the furthest-forward individual in the population. The asymptotic wave speed for a constant net reproductive rate R0 is approximated as (1/T)(piuR)/2)(1/2) m yr(-1), where T is generation time, and u is a distance parameter (m2) of Clark et al.'s 2Dt model having shape parameter p = 1. From fitted dispersal kernels with fat tails and infinite variance, we derive finite rates of spread and a simple method for numerical estimation. Fitted kernels, with infinite variance, yield distributions of rates of spread that are asymptotically normal and, thus, have finite moments. Variable reproduction can profoundly affect rates of spread. By incorporating the variance in reproduction that results from variable life span, we estimate much lower rates than predicted by the standard approach, which assumes a constant net reproductive rate. Using basic life-history data for trees, we show these estimated rates to be lower than expected from previous analytical models and as interpreted from paleorecords of forest spread at the end of the Pleistocene. Our results suggest reexamination of past rates of spread and the potential for future response to climate change.},

Consensus trees from separate and combined analyses are congruent and agree well with nonmolecular data (chromosome numbers, fruit and wood anatomy, leaf glycosides, and iridoids). The two debated genera Dimetra and Nyctanthes, previously suggested to belong to Verbenaceae (sensu lato) or Nyctanthaceae, are shown to belong to Oleaceae, sister to the hitherto genus incertae sedis Myxopyrum. This clade is also supported by anatomical and chemical data. The subfamily Jasminoideae is paraphyletic, and a new classification is presented. The subfamily level is abandoned, and the former Jasminoideae is split into four tribes: Myxopyreae (Myxopyrum, Nyctanthes, and Dimetra), Fontanesieae (Fontanesia), Forsythieae (Abeliophyllum and Forsythia), and Jasmineae (Jasminum and Menodora). The tribe Oleeae (previous subfamily Oleoideae) is clearly monophyletic, comprising the subtribes Ligustrinae (Syringa and Ligustrum), Schreberinae status novus (Schrebera and Comoranthus), Fraxininae status novus (Fraxinus), and Oleinae (12 drupaceous genera). An rps16 sequence obtained from Hesperelaea, known only from the type specimen collected in 1875, confirmed the placement of this extinct taxon in the subtribe Oleinae.},

However, communities can be structured by a combination of both local and regional processes and to date, few community genetics studies have examined whether the effects of instraspecific genetic variation are consistent across levels of diversity. In this study, we ask whether host-plant genetic variation structures communities of arthropod inquilines within distinct habitat patches--rosette leaf galls on tall goldenrod (Solidago altissima). We found that genetic variation determined inquiline diversity at both local and regional spatial scales, but that trophic-level responses varied independently of one another. This result suggests that herbivores and predators likely respond to heritable plant traits at different spatial scales. Together, our results show that incorporating spatial scale is essential for predicting the effects of genetically variable traits on different trophic levels and levels of diversity within the communities that depend on host plants.},

abstract = {In heterogeneous landscapes, divergent selection can favor the evolution of locally adapted ecotypes, especially when interhabitat gene flow is minimal. However, if habitats differ in size or quality, source-sink dynamics can shape evolutionary trajectories. Upland and bottomland forests of the southeastern USA differ in water table depth, light availability, edaphic conditions, and plant community. We conducted a multiyear reciprocal transplant experiment to test whether Elliott's blueberry (Vaccinium elliottii) is locally adapted to these contrasting environments. Additionally, we exposed seedlings and cuttings to prolonged drought and flooding in the greenhouse to assess fitness responses to abiotic stress. Contrary to predictions of local adaptation, V. elliottii families exhibited significantly higher survivorship and growth in upland than in bottomland forests and under drought than flooded conditions, regardless of habitat of origin. Neutral population differentiation was minimal, suggesting widespread interhabitat migration. Population density, reproductive output, and genetic diversity were all significantly greater in uplands than in bottomlands. These disparities likely result in asymmetric gene flow from uplands to bottomlands. Thus, adaptation to a marginal habitat can be constrained by small populations, limited fitness, and immigration from a benign habitat. Our study highlights the importance of demography and genetic diversity in the evolution of local (mal)adaptation.},

abstract = {The perennial soybeans (Glycine subgenus Glycine), are the sister group of the annual cultivated soybean (G. max). Among the approximately 20 species are diploids and polyploids, the former confined to Australia and neighboring islands and the latter more widespread. Although most subgenus Glycine species reproduce predominantly by selfing in cleistogamous flowers, phylogenetic evidence exists for reticulate evolution throughout the history of the subgenus. The entire genus is a paleopolyploid, and could possibly be allopolyploid, though there is as yet no evidence for a hybrid origin. Incongruence among the major nuclear genome groups in nuclear and chloroplast gene trees can be explained by several ancient introgressions. Within the B-genome group there is substantial incongruence between chloroplast and nuclear single copy gene trees that is explained better by introgressive hybridization than by stochastic sorting of ancestral lineages. Several allopolyploids originated by hybridization among a subset of genome groups to form a single large interconnected polyploid complex. A number of allopolyploid combinations have arisen recurrently, some bidirectionally. Some recurrent polyploids show evidence of lineage recombination, indicating that their populations comprise a single biological species. Neopolyploidy has involved hybridization among a subset of subgenus Glycine genome groups, and appears to have occurred recently, whereas hybridization at the diploid level has occurred throughout the history of the group.

abstract = {Species turnover, or beta diversity, has been predicted to decrease with increasing latitude, but few studies have tested this relationship. Here, we examined the beta diversity-latitude relationship for vascular plants at a continental scale, based on complete species lists of native vascular plants for entire states or provinces in North America (north of Mexico). We calculated beta diversity as the slope of the relationship between the natural logarithm of the Jaccard index (lnJ ) for families, genera or species, and both geographic distance and climate difference within five latitude zones. We found that beta diversity decreased from south to north; within latitude zones, it decreased from species to genera and families. Geographic and climatic distance explained about the same proportion of the variance in lnJ in zones south of c. 50 degrees N. North of this latitude, nearly all the explained variance in lnJ was attributable to geographic distance. Therefore, decreasing beta diversity from south to north reflects decreasing climate differentiation within more northerly latitude zones, and primarily post-glacial dispersal limitation north of 50 degrees N.},

abstract = {The importance of neutral dynamics is contentiously debated in the ecological literature. This debate focuses on neutral theory's assumption of fitness equivalency among individuals, which conflicts with stabilizing fitness that promotes coexistence through niche differentiation. I take advantage of competition-colonization trade-offs between species of aquatic micro-organisms (protozoans and rotifers) to show that equalizing and stabilizing mechanisms can operate simultaneously. Competition trials between species with similar colonization abilities were less likely to result in competitive exclusion than for species further apart. While the stabilizing mechanism (colonization differences) facilitates coexistence at large spatial scales, species with similar colonization abilities also exhibited local coexistence probably due to fitness similarities allowing weak stabilizing mechanisms to operate. These results suggest that neutral- and niche-based mechanisms of coexistence can simultaneously operate at differing temporal and spatial scales, and such a spatially explicit view of coexistence may be one way to reconcile niche and neutral dynamics.},

abstract = {Here we give an introduction to the growing number of statistical techniques for analyzing data that are not independent realizations of the same sampling process--in other words, correlated data. We focus on regression problems, in which the value of a given variable depends linearly on the value of another variable. To illustrate different types of processes leading to correlated data, we analyze four simulated examples representing diverse problems arising in ecological studies. The first example is a comparison among species to determine the relationship between home-range area and body size; because species are phylogenetically related, they do not represent independent samples. The second example addresses spatial variation in net primary production and how this might be affected by soil nitrogen; because nearby locations are likely to have similar net primary productivity for reasons other than soil nitrogen, spatial correlation is likely. In the third example, we consider a time-series model to ask whether the decrease in density of a butterfly species is the result of decreases in its host-plant density; because the population density of a species in one generation is likely to affect the density in the following generation, time-series data are often correlated. The fourth example combines both spatial and temporal correlation in an experiment in which prey densities are manipulated to determine the response of predators to their food supply. For each of these examples, we use a different statistical approach for analyzing models of correlated data. Our goal is to give an overview of conceptual issues surrounding correlated data, rather than a detailed tutorial in how to apply different statistical techniques. By dispelling some of the mystery behind correlated data, we hope to encourage ecologists to learn about statistics that could be useful in their own work. Although at first encounter these techniques might seem complicated, they have the power to simplify ecological research by making more types of data and experimental designs open to statistical evaluation.},

abstract = {Co-occurring congener plant species in the highly diverse Atlantic forests of southeastern Brazil may act as natural laboratories for evaluating evolution of reproductive shifts. We assessed the breeding systems in a sympatric assemblage of bromeliad species and compiled literature available for the family to compare our experiments with available information. We performed controlled experiments of autonomous selfing, self- and cross-pollination in 40 species of 11 genera of two subfamilies that, in general, overlap their blooming period and share the same pollination vectors. We also tested for differences between self-compatible (SC) and self-incompatible (SI) species with regard to ecological factors such as abundance, co-flowering and co-occurrence. Most species experimentally tested and surveyed in the literature (75{\%}) were SC. Species from the subfamily Tillandsioideae were predominantly SC, while Bromelioideae showed greater variation in breeding systems. About 43{\%} of the species studied set fruits spontaneously in the absence of pollinator vectors. We found that SC species were the more abundant, were more frequently associated with other relatives and overlapped their blooming period with other species more than SI species. Thus, our results suggest that self-compatibility is common for Bromeliaceae and do not support the traditional hypothesis of reproductive assurance used to explain the evolution of selfing. We discuss self-compatibility as a reproductive isolating mechanism in the presence of pollen flow among sympatric congener species. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The relative number of seeds produced by competing species can influence the community structure; yet, traits that influence seed production, such as pollinator attraction and floral colour, have received little attention in community ecology. Here, we analyse floral colour using reflectance spectra that include near-UV and examined the phylogenetic signal of floral colour. We found that coflowering species within communities tended to be more divergent in floral colour than expected by chance. However, coflowering species were not phylogenetically dispersed, in part due to our finding that floral colour is a labile trait with a weak phylogenetic signal. Furthermore, while we found that locally rare and common species exhibited equivalent floral colour distances from their coflowering neighbours, frequent species (those found in more communities) exhibited higher colour distances from their coflowering neighbours. Our findings support recent studies, which have found that (i) plant lineages exhibit frequent floral colour transitions; and (ii) traits that influence local population dynamics contribute to community structure.},

abstract = {A unified theory in science is a theory that shows a common underlying set of rules that regulate processes previously thought to be distinct. Unified theories have been important in physics including the unification of electricity and magnetism and the unification of the electromagnetic with the weak nuclear force. Surprisingly, ecology, specifically the subfields of biodiversity and macroecology, also possess not one but at least six unified theories. This is problematic as only one unified theory is desirable. Superficially, the six unified theories seem very different. However, I show that all six theories use the same three rules or assertions to describe a stochastic geometry of biodiversity. The three rules are: (1) intraspecifically individuals are clumped together; (2) interspecifically global or regional abundance varies according to a hollow curve distribution; and (3) interspecifically individuals are placed without regard to individuals of other species. These three rules appear sufficient to explain local species abundance distributions, species-area relationships, decay of similarity of distance and possibly other patterns of biodiversity. This provides a unification of the unified theories. I explore implications of this unified theory for future research.},

abstract = {Recent studies of communities have examined phylogenetic signal in species' functional traits to infer drivers of community assembly. Phenotypic variation in traits, arising from ‘‘constitutive'' genetically based variation and from environmental influences on gene expression, or phenotypic plasticity, could affect inferences about community assembly. We found significant trait plasticity in 12 focal species across four species–interaction treatments grown in four soil environments. Phylogenetic signal in traits was present, but was also dependent on species–interactor treatment, suggesting that phenotypic plasticity and plant neighborhood could affect the ability to detect and interpret community phylogenetic patterns of trait variation. Individuals competing with conspecifics expressed significant divergence in specific leaf area (SLA) relative to when they were grown alone. Combined with the observation that competition is stronger between close relatives than between distant relatives in some soils, these results suggest that trait plasticity may be an adaptive response to competition. To test this hypothesis, we examined total biomass in a pot, relative to the predicted biomass of two individuals grown alone, and related pot biomass to phylogenetic distance of the interactor treatment, as well as to divergence in SLA and root : shoot ratio. Within competition treatments, only plastic divergence in root : shoot ratio in one interactor treatment was correlated with increased productivity, and only in one soil type. We also tested whether, across all treatments, divergence in SLA or root : shoot ratio increased pot productivity. We found that ‘‘community'' productivity was positively influenced both by phylogenetic distance to competitor, as well as by divergence in root : shoot ratio due to both plasticity and constitutive differences. Phenotypic plasticity resulting in trait divergence may increase the ability of plants to coexist and may also decrease phylogenetic signal in community assembly at small spatial scales.},

abstract = {Abstract The mulberry family Moraceae comprises 37 genera and approximately 1,100 species distributed throughout tropical and temperate regions worldwide. Moraceae exhibit a complex array of inflorescence architectures, breeding systems, and pollination syndromes, which forms the basis of traditional taxonomic classification. However, morphologically based classification conflicts with evolutionary relationships proposed by molecular phylogenetics. In this study we assembled a morphological character matrix for analysis separately and in combination with existing molecular data. We evaluated 81 vegetative, reproductive, and wood anatomical characters for 94 species representing nearly all Moraceae genera. Using parsimony and Bayesian methods, these characters were evaluated with respect to ndhF chloroplast and 26S nuclear DNA sequences. Topological comparisons tested whether opposing classification schemes are more or less supported by the data. Results did not support any classification of Moraceae based on morphology. We present a revised tribal classification and describe a new tribe, Maclureae, revise the membership of tribe Castilleae and describe two subtribes, Castillineae and Antiaropsineae, and reinstate the genera Malaisia (including Malaisia scandens) and Sloetia (including Sloetia elongata). Lastly we discuss the evolution of inflorescence architecture in relation to other floral features.},

abstract = {In a comparative study of 42 rainforest tree species we examined relationships amongst wood traits, diameter growth and survival of large trees in the field, and shade tolerance and adult stature of the species. *The species show two orthogonal axes of trait variation: a primary axis related to the vessel size-number trade-off (reflecting investment in hydraulic conductance vs hydraulic safety) and a secondary axis related to investment in parenchyma vs fibres (storage vs strength). Across species, growth rate was positively related to vessel diameter and potential specific hydraulic conductance (K(p)), and negatively related to wood density. Survival rate was only positively related to wood density. *Light-demanding species were characterized by low wood and vessel density and wide vessels. Tall species were characterized by wide vessels with low density and large K(p). Hydraulic traits were more closely associated with adult stature than with light demand, possibly because tall canopy species experience more drought stress and face a higher cavitation risk. *Vessel traits affect growth and wood density affects growth and survival of large trees in the field. Vessel traits and wood density are therefore important components of the performance and life history strategies of tropical tree species.},

abstract = {Phylogenetic relationships among 48 species of Prunus were investigated by means of maximum parsimony analysis of sequence polymorphism from nuclear ITS and chloroplast trnL-trnF spacer DNA. Several genera that have been implicated as close relatives of Prunus in previous studies were utilized as outgroups. The objective of this study was to reconstruct the phylogeny of Prunus with the purpose of reviewing previously described taxonomic relationships and providing a basis for studies of morphological evolution in the genus. Variability and homoplasy are higher in ITS than in trnL-trnF Parsimony analysis of both markers, separately and in combination, supported a close relationship among Exochorda, Oemleria, and Prinsepia but did not support a sister relationship of this clade with Prunus. Prunus is monophyletic and divided into two groups. The first is a strongly supported clade composed of subgenera Padus, Laurocerasus, and Cerasus. None of these subgenera is monophyletic and the trait used to characterize Padus and Laurocerasus, flowers arranged in racemes, can be more broadly interpreted as a synapomorphy for the clade. The second group included the subgenera Amygdalus and Prunus, and sections Microcerasus (subgenus Cerasus), and Penarmeniaca, which has never been assigned to a subgenus, The exclusively North American subgenus Emplectocladus may be an early diverging taxon sister to the second group. Sections Prunus and Armeniaca arc monophyletic with low bootstrap support. Section Penarmeniaca, from Southwestern US, and P. besseyi (section Microcerasus) are sister taxa. A Eurasian origin of Prunus is supported.},

abstract = {Statistical models of environment-abundance relationships may be influenced by spatial autocorrelation in abundance, environmental variables, or both. Failure to account for spatial autocorrelation can lead to incorrect conclusions regarding both the absolute and relative importance of environmental variables as determinants of abundance. We consider several classes of statistical models that are appropriate for modeling environment-abundance relationships in the presence of spatial autocorrelation, and apply these to three case studies: 1) abundance of voles in relation to habitat characteristics; 2) a plant competition experiment; and 3) abundance of Orbatid mites along environmental gradients. We find that when spatial pattern is accounted for in the modeling process, conclusions about environmental control over abundance can change dramatically. We conclude with five lessons: 1) spatial models are easy to calculate with several of the most common statistical packages; 2) results from spatially-structured models may point to conclusions radically different from those suggested by a spatially independent model; 3) not all spatial autocorrelation in abundances results from spatial population dynamics; it may also result from abundance associations with environmental variables not included in the model; 4) the different spatial models do have different mechanistic interpretations in terms of ecological processes – thus ecological model selection should take primacy over statistical model selection; 5) the conclusions of the different spatial models are typically fairly similar – making any correction is more important than quibbling about which correction to make.},

abstract = {Approximately one-half of all species of amphibians occur in the New World tropics, which includes South America, Middle America, and the West Indies. Of those, 27{\%} (801 species) belong to a large assemblage, the eleutherodactyline frogs, which breed out of water and lay eggs that undergo direct development on land. Their wide distribution and mode of reproduction offer potential for resolving questions in evolution, ecology, and conservation. However, progress in all of these fields has been hindered by a poor understanding of their evolutionary relationships. As a result, most of the species have been placed in a single genus, Eleutherodactylus, which is the largest among vertebrates. Our DNA sequence analysis of a major fraction of eleutherodactyline diversity revealed three large radiations of species with unexpected geographic isolation: a South American Clade (393 sp.), a Caribbean Clade (171 sp.), and a Middle American Clade (111 sp.). Molecular clock analyses reject the prevailing hypothesis that these frogs arose from land connections with North and South America and their subsequent fragmentation in the Late Cretaceous (80-70 Mya). Origin by dispersal, probably over water from South America in the early Cenozoic (47-29 million years ago, Mya), is more likely.},

abstract = {In this article we report the results of an experiment introducing 17 native shrub and tree species into a Brazilian restinga (i.e., coastal sandy plain vegetation). Restingas have been affected by human impact for about 8,000 years, and human occupation for housing, tourism, and land speculation has recently increased in such a way that there is a need for conservation of remnant patches and restoration of degraded areas throughout the coast to protect biodiversity. Our study site is a remnant located in Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country, and has been subjected in the past to deforestation, man-made fire, and sand extraction. Although trees and shrubs predominantly compose natural restinga vegetation, local vegetation after impact was replaced by an exotic grass cover, which meant a drastic reduction in species richness. Thus, in this experiment we removed the grass cover, introduced shrub and tree species, and monitored survival and growth of 20 plants per species for 2 years. Despite the adversities imposed by the nutrient-poor sandy soil, 70{\%} of the species showed high survival percentage and considerable growth. This report on restoration initiatives in the restingas points out the viability of shrub and tree plantation following exotic grass removal as a strategy to restore Brazilian coastal vegetation},

abstract = {Research aimed at understanding the geographic context of evolutionary histories is burgeoning across biological disciplines. Recent endeavors attempt to interpret contemporaneous genetic variation in the light of increasingly detailed geographical and environmental observations. Such interest has promoted the development of phylogeographic inference techniques that explicitly aim to integrate such heterogeneous data. One promising development involves reconstructing phylogeographic history on a continuous landscape. Here, we present a Bayesian statistical approach to infer continuous phylogeographic diffusion using random walk models while simultaneously reconstructing the evolutionary history in time from molecular sequence data. Moreover, by accommodating branch-specific variation in dispersal rates, we relax the most restrictive assumption of the standard Brownian diffusion process and demonstrate increased statistical efficiency in spatial reconstructions of overdispersed random walks by analyzing both simulated and real viral genetic data. We further illustrate how drawing inference about summary statistics from a fully specified stochastic process over both sequence evolution and spatial movement reveals important characteristics of a rabies epidemic. Together with recent advances in discrete phylogeographic inference, the continuous model developments furnish a flexible statistical framework for biogeographical reconstructions that is easily expanded upon to accommodate various landscape genetic features.},

Surprisingly, assuming that genetic lineages follow a coalescent model of within-species evolution, we find that for any species tree topology with five or more species, there exist branch lengths for which gene tree discordance is so common that the most likely gene tree topology to evolve along the branches of a species tree differs from the species phylogeny. This counterintuitive result implies that in combining data on multiple loci, the straightforward procedure of using the most frequently observed gene tree topology as an estimate of the species tree topology can be asymptotically guaranteed to produce an incorrect estimate. We conclude with suggestions that can aid in overcoming this new obstacle to accurate genomic inference of species phylogenies.},

Costs and limits of plasticity have been proposed as important constraints on the evolution of plasticity, yet confusion exists over their distinction. We attempt to clarify these concepts by reviewing their categorization and measurement, highlighting how costs and limits are defined in different currencies (and may describe the same phenomenon). Conclusions from studies that measure the costs of plasticity have been equivocal, but we caution that these conclusions may be premature owing to a potentially common correlation between environment-specific trait values and the magnitude of trait plasticities (i.e. multi-collinearity) that results in imprecise and/or biased estimates of the costs. Meanwhile, our understanding of the limits of plasticity, and how they may be underlain by the costs of plasticity, is still in its infancy. Based on our re-evaluation of these constraints, we discuss areas for future research.},

abstract = {Dry forest environments limit the number of species that can survive there. Antillean dry forests have low floristic diversity and stature, high density of small and medium-sized trees, and are among the least conserved of the tropical forests. Their canopies are smooth with no emergent trees and have high species dominance. Antillean dry forests occur mostly on limestone substrate, exposing them to more water stress and nutrient limitations than other dry forests. They also experience periodic hurricanes and anthropogenic disturbances. Many of the attributes that allow plants to survive in the stressful environment of the dry forest also provide resilience to disturbance. We attribute the high resilience of Antillean dry forests to the diversity of life forms, a high resistance to wind, a high proportion of root biomass, high soil carbon and nutrient accumulation belowground, the ability of most tree species to resprout and high nutrient-use efficiency. However, opening the canopy, eroding the soil and removing root biomass decreases forest resilience and allows alien species invasion.},

This paper explores the possibility of using standard, well-behaved Markov models for estimating morphological phylogenies (including branch lengths) under the likelihood criterion. An important modification of standard Markov models involves making the likelihood conditional on characters being variable, because constant characters are absent in morphological data sets. Without this modification, branch lengths are often overestimated, resulting in potentially serious biases in tree topology selection. Several new avenues of research are opened by an explicitly model-based approach to phylogenetic analysis of discrete morphological data, including combined-data likelihood analyses (morphology + sequence data), likelihood ratio tests, and Bayesian analyses.},

abstract = {Species of the large family Orchidaceae display a spectacular array of adaptations and rapid speciations that are linked to several innovative features, including specialized pollination syndromes, colonization of epiphytic habitats, and the presence of Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM), a water-conserving photosynthetic pathway. To better understand the role of CAM and epiphytism in the evolutionary expansion of tropical orchids, we sampled leaf carbon isotopic composition of 1,103 species native to Panama and Costa Rica, performed character state reconstruction and phylogenetic trait analysis of CAM and epiphytism, and related strong CAM, present in 10{\%} of species surveyed, to climatic variables and the evolution of epiphytism in tropical regions. Altitude was the most important predictor of photosynthetic pathway when all environmental variables were taken into account, with CAM being most prevalent at low altitudes. By creating integrated orchid trees to reconstruct ancestral character states, we found that C3 photosynthesis is the ancestral state and that CAM has evolved at least 10 independent times with several reversals. A large CAM radiation event within the Epidendroideae, the most species-rich epiphytic clade of any known plant group, is linked to a Tertiary species radiation that originated 65 million years ago. Our study shows that parallel evolution of CAM is present among subfamilies of orchids, and correlated divergence between photosynthetic pathways and epiphytism can be explained by the prevalence of CAM in low-elevation epiphytes and rapid speciation of high-elevation epiphytes in the Neotropics, contributing to the astounding diversity in the Orchidaceae.},

Because phylogenies are normally inferences from data, it is desirable to account for the uncertainty in estimates of the tree and its branch lengths when making inferences about ancestral states or other comparative parameters. Here we present a general Bayesian approach for testing comparative hypotheses across statistically justified samples of phylogenies, focusing on the specific issue of reconstructing ancestral states. The method uses Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques for sampling phylogenetic trees and for investigating the parameters of a statistical model of trait evolution. We describe how to combine information about the uncertainty of the phylogeny with uncertainty in the estimate of the ancestral state. Our approach does not constrain the sample of trees only to those that contain the ancestral node or nodes of interest, and we show how to reconstruct ancestral states of uncertain nodes using a most-recent-common-ancestor approach. We illustrate the methods with data on ribonuclease evolution in the Artiodactyla. Software implementing the methods (BayesMultiState) is available from the authors.},

abstract = {One of the primary goals of population genetics is to succinctly describe genetic relationships among populations, and the computer program STRUCTURE is one of the most frequently used tools for doing so. The mathematical model used by STRUCTURE was designed to sort individuals into Hardy-Weinberg populations, but the program is also frequently used to group individuals from a large number of populations into a small number of clusters that are supposed to represent the main genetic divisions within species. In this study, I used computer simulations to examine how well STRUCTURE accomplishes this latter task. Simulations of populations that had a simple hierarchical history of fragmentation showed that when there were relatively long divergence times within evolutionary lineages, the clusters created by STRUCTURE were frequently not consistent with the evolutionary history of the populations. These difficulties can be attributed to forcing STRUCTURE to place individuals into too few clusters. Simulations also showed that the clusters produced by STRUCTURE can be strongly influenced by variation in sample size. In some circumstances, STRUCTURE simply put all of the individuals from the largest sample in the same cluster. A reanalysis of human population structure suggests that the problems I identified with STRUCTURE in simulations may have obscured relationships among human populations-particularly genetic similarity between Europeans and some African populations.},

Divergence times of putative disjunct species pairs were estimated from synonymous substitutions, using rbcL molecular clocks calibrated for Cornus. Relative rate tests were performed to assess rate constancy of rbcL evolution among lineages. Corrections of estimates of divergence times for each species pair were made based on rate differences of rbcL between Cornus and other species pairs. Results of these analyses indicate that the time of divergence of species pairs examined ranges from 12.56 +/- 4.30 million years to recent ({\textless}0.31 million years), with most within the last 10 million years (in the late Miocene and Pliocene). These results suggest that the isolation of most morphologically similar disjunct species in eastern Asia and eastern North America occurred during the global climatic cooling period that took place throughout the late Tertiary and Quaternary. This estimate is closely correlated with paleontological evidence and in agreement with the hypothesis that considers the eastern Asian-eastern North American floristic disjunction to be the result of the range restriction of a once more or less continuously distributed mixed mesophytic forest of the Northern Hemisphere that occurred during the late Tertiary and Quaternary. This implies that in most taxa the disjunction may have resulted from vicariance events. However, long-distance dispersal may explain the disjunct distribution of taxa with low divergence, such as Menispermum.},

abstract = {There is a long tradition in ecology of studying models of biodiversity at equilibrium. These models, including the influential Neutral Theory of Biodiversity, have been successful at predicting major macroecological patterns, such as species abundance distributions. But they have failed to predict macroevolutionary patterns, such as those captured in phylogenetic trees. Here, we develop a model of biodiversity in which all individuals have identical demographic rates, metacommunity size is allowed to vary stochastically according to population dynamics, and speciation arises naturally from the accumulation of point mutations. We show that this model generates phylogenies matching those observed in nature if the metacommunity is out of equilibrium. We develop a likelihood inference framework that allows fitting our model to empirical phylogenies, and apply this framework to various mammalian families. Our results corroborate the hypothesis that biodiversity dynamics are out of equilibrium.},

abstract = {Internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences of nuclear ribosomal DNA from 44 taxa of the genus Lupinus and five outgroup taxa were used for phylogenetic analysis. Lupinus appears as a strongly supported monophyletic genus, which is unambiguously part of the Genisteae. The lupines are distributed into five main clades in general accordance with their geographical origin. In the Old World, almost all the recognized taxonomic units are well resolved. The ITS data reveal an unexpectedly close relationship between the diverse sections Angustifoli and Lutei. The ITS results suggest a geographical division between the western New World lupines and the eastern ones. They also indicate the presence of some moderately to strongly supported groups of taxa, such as the Microcarpi–Pusilli group, the L. spariflorus–L. arizonicus group, the L. mexicanus–L. elegans group in the western New World, and the notable L. multiflorus–L. paraguariensis group in the eastern New World. The latter group strongly suggests that the eastern South American compound- and simple-leaved perennial lupines derive from a common ancestor. However, apart from some exceptions, relationships within the genus still remain largely unresolved based on ITS data. The lack of resolution at the base of the genus is suggestive of a rapid initial radiation of the lupines subsequent to the dispersal of their common ancestor. Relative rate tests demonstrate the presence of rate heterogeneity of ITS sequences within Lupinus. In many pairwise comparisons between taxa, substitution rate inequalities are correlated with the habit (annual, perennial), suggesting some role for the generation time effects in the evolutionary history of lupines.},

abstract = {Temperate climates are defined by distinct temperature seasonality with large and often unpredictable weather during any of the four seasons. To thrive in such climates, trees have to withstand a cold winter and the stochastic occurrence of freeze events during any time of the year. The physiological mechanisms trees adopt to escape, avoid, and tolerate freezing temperatures include a cold acclimation in autumn, a dormancy period during winter (leafless in deciduous trees), and the maintenance of a certain freezing tolerance during dehardening in early spring. The change from one phase to the next is mediated by complex interactions between temperature and photoperiod. This review aims at providing an overview of the interplay between phenology of leaves and species-specific freezing resistance. First, we address the long-term evolutionary responses that enabled temperate trees to tolerate certain low temperature extremes. We provide evidence that short term acclimation of freezing resistance plays a crucial role both in dormant and active buds, including re-acclimation to cold conditions following warm spells. This ability declines to almost zero during leaf emergence. Second, we show that the risk that native temperate trees encounter freeze injuries is low and is confined to spring and underline that this risk might be altered by climate warming depending on species-specific phenological responses to environmental cues.},

In this article we describe patterns of functional trait variation and trait correlations within and among habitats in relation to several environmental and trade-off axes. We then ask whether such patterns reflect natural selection and can be considered plant strategies. In so doing we highlight evidence that demonstrates that (1) patterns of trait variation across resource and environmental gradients (light, water, nutrients, and temperature) probably reflect adaptation, (2) plant trait variation typically involves multiple-correlated traits that arise because of inevitable trade-offs among traits and across levels of whole-plant integration and that must be understood from a whole-plant perspective, and (3) such adaptation may be globally generalizable for like conditions; i. e., the set of traits (collections of traits in syndromes) of taxa can be considered as "plant strategies."},

However, tests of this assumption are rare and field-based experiments lacking. We tested the relationship between competition, the degree of relatedness, and overdi-spersion among plants experimentally and using a field survey in a native grassland. Relatedness did not affect competition, nor was competition associated with phylogenetic overdispersion. Further, there was only weak evidence for increased overdispersion at spatial scales where plants are likely to compete. These results challenge traditional theory, but are consistent with recent theories regarding the mechanisms of plant competition and its potential effect on phylogenetic structure. We suggest that specific conditions related to the form of competition and trait conservatism must be met for competition to cause phyloge-netic overdispersion. Consequently, overdispersion as a result of competition is likely to be rare in natural communities.},

abstract = {Current estimators of gene flow come in two methods; those that estimate parameters assuming that the populations investigated are a small random sample of a large number of populations and those that assume that all populations were sampled. Maximum likelihood or Bayesian approaches that estimate the migration rates and population sizes directly using coalescent theory can easily accommodate datasets that contain a population that has no data, a so-called 'ghost' population. This manipulation allows us to explore the effects of missing populations on the estimation of population sizes and migration rates between two specific populations. The biases of the inferred population parameters depend on the magnitude of the migration rate from the unknown populations. The effects on the population sizes are larger than the effects on the migration rates. The more immigrants from the unknown populations that are arriving in the sample populations the larger the estimated population sizes. Taking into account a ghost population improves or at least does not harm the estimation of population sizes. Estimates of the scaled migration rate M (migration rate per generation divided by the mutation rate per generation) are fairly robust as long as migration rates from the unknown populations are not huge. The inclusion of a ghost population does not improve the estimation of the migration rate M; when the migration rates are estimated as the number of immigrants Nm then a ghost population improves the estimates because of its effect on population size estimation. It seems that for 'real world' analyses one should carefully choose which populations to sample, but there is no need to sample every population in the neighbourhood of a population of interest.},

abstract = {• Premise of the study: The clusioid clade includes five families (i.e., Bonnetiaceae, Calophyllaceae, Clusiaceae s.s., Hypericaceae, and Podostemaceae) represented by 94 genera and ∼1900 species. Species in this clade form a conspicuous element of tropical forests worldwide and are important in horticulture, timber production, and pharmacology. We conducted a taxon-rich multigene phylogenetic analysis of the clusioids to clarify phylogenetic relationships in this clade. • Methods: We analyzed plastid (matK, ndhF, and rbcL) and mitochondrial (matR) nucleotide sequence data using parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference. Our combined data set included 194 species representing all major clusioid subclades, plus numerous species spanning the taxonomic, morphological, and biogeographic breadth of the clusioid clade. • Key results: Our results indicate that Tovomita (Clusiaceae s.s.), Harungana and Hypericum (Hypericaceae), and Ledermanniella s.s. and Zeylanidium (Podostemaceae) are not monophyletic. In addition, we place four genera that have not been included in any previous molecular study: Ceratolacis, Diamantina, and Griffithella (Podostemaceae), and Santomasia (Hypericaceae). Finally, our results indicate that Lianthus, Santomasia, Thornea, and Triadenum can be safely merged into Hypericum (Hypericaceae). • Conclusions: We present the first well-resolved, taxon-rich phylogeny of the clusioid clade. Taxon sampling and resolution within the clade are greatly improved compared to previous studies and provide a strong basis for improving the classification of the group. In addition, our phylogeny will form the foundation for our future work investigating the biogeography of tropical angiosperms that exhibit Gondwanan distributions.},

abstract = {The importance of hybridization in plant speciation and evolution has been debated for decades, with opposing views of hybridization as ei-ther a creative evolutionary force or evolutionary noise. Hybrid speci-ation may occur at either the homoploid (i.e., between two species of the same ploidy) or the polyploid level, each with its attendant genetic and evolutionary consequences. Whereas allopolyploidy (i.e., resulting from hybridization and genome doubling) has long been recognized as an important mode of plant speciation, the implications of genome duplication have typically not been taken into account in most fields of plant biology. Recent developments in genomics are revolutioniz-ing our views of angiosperm genomes, demonstrating that perhaps all angiosperms have likely undergone at least one round of polyploidiza-tion and that hybridization has been an important force in generating angiosperm species diversity. Hybridization and polyploid formation continue to generate species diversity, with several new allopolyploids having originated just within the past century or so. The origins of polyploid species—whether via hybridization between species or be-tween genetically differentiated populations of a single species—and the immediate genetic consequences of polyploid formation are there-fore receiving enthusiastic attention. The time is therefore right for a review of the role of hybridization in plant speciation.},

Understanding when and how these orchids diversified is vital to understanding the history of epiphytic biomes. We investigated whether orchids managed to radiate so explosively owing to their predominantly epiphytic habit and/or their specialized pollinator systems by testing these hypotheses from a statistical and phylogenetic standpoint. For the first approach, species numbers of 100 randomly chosen epiphytic and terrestrial genera were compared. Furthermore, the mean number of pollinators per orchid species within the five subfamilies was calculated and correlated with their time of diversification and species richness. In the second approach, molecular epiphytic orchid phylogenies were screened for clades with specific suites of epiphytic adaptations. Epiphytic genera were found to be significantly richer in species than terrestrial genera both for orchids and non-orchids. No evidence was found for a positive association between pollinator specialization and orchid species richness. Repeated associations between a small body size, short life cycle and specialized clinging roots of twig epiphytes in Bulbophyllinae and Oncidiinae were discovered. The development of twig epiphytism in the first group seems repeatedly correlated with speciation bursts.},

abstract = {Closely related species that occur together in commu- nities and experience similar environmental conditions are likely to share phenotypic traits because of the process of environmental fil- tering. At the same time, species that are too similar are unlikely to co-occur because of competitive exclusion. In an effort to explain the coexistence of 17 oak species within forest communities in North Central Florida, we examined correlations between the phylogenetic relatedness of oak species, their degree of co-occurrence within com- munities and niche overlap across environmental gradients, and their similarity in ecophysiological and life-history traits. We show that the oaks are phylogenetically overdispersed because co-occurring spe- cies are more distantly related than expected by chance, and oaks within the same clade show less niche overlap than expected. Hence, communities are more likely to include members of both the red oak and the white?live oak clades than only members of one clade. This pattern of phylogenetic overdispersion arises because traits im- portant for habitat specialization show evolutionary convergence.We hypothesize further that certain conserved traits permit coexistence of distantly related congeners. These results provide an explanation for how oak diversity is maintained at the community level in North Central Florida},

We demonstrated that different marker densities can be attained by choice of restriction enzyme. Furthermore, we developed a barcoding system for sample multiplexing and fine mapped the genetic basis of lateral plate armor loss in threespine stickleback by identifying recombinant breakpoints in F2 individuals. Barcoding also facilitated mapping of a second trait, a reduction of pelvic structure, by in silico re-sorting of individuals. To further demonstrate the ease of the RAD sequencing approach we identified polymorphic markers and mapped an induced mutation in Neurospora crassa. Sequencing of RAD markers is an integrated platform for SNP discovery and genotyping. This approach should be widely applicable to genetic mapping in a variety of organisms.},

All six pairwise combinations of data sets were examined using tree comparisons, the incongruence length difference test, the Wilcoxon signed ranks test, and a permutation test. We describe some advantages, disadvantages, and properties of the different comparison methods. Test results pro- vide no evidence for significant differences in the phylogenetic signal among the three nuclear data sets, with the exception of the placement of a single taxon. The chloroplast DNA restriction site data, however, support a significantly different tree, and the differences probably reflect a separate evolutionary history of the chloroplast genome.},

abstract = {herbivores that consume them, and they are one of the major conduits of energy flow up to higher trophic levels. Here, we address the processes that have generated the spectacular diversity of flowering plants ({\textgreater}300,000 species) and insect herbivores (likely {\textgreater}1 million species). Long-standing macroevolutionary hypotheses have postulated that reciprocal evolution of adaptations and subsequent bursts of speciation have given rise to much of this biodiversity. We critically evaluate various predictions based on this coevolutionary theory. Phylogenetic reconstruction of ancestral states has revealed evidence for escalation in the potency or variety of plant lineages' chemical defenses; however, escalation of defense has been moderated by tradeoffs and alternative strategies (e.g., tolerance or defense by biotic agents). There is still surprisingly scant evidence that novel defense traits reduce herbivory and that such evolutionary novelty spurs diversification. Consistent with the Co-evolutionary hypothesis, there is some evidence that diversification of herbivores has lagged behind, but has nevertheless been temporally correlated with that of their host-plant clades, indicating colonization and radiation of insects on diversifying plants. However, there is still limited support for the role of host-plant shifts in insect diversification. Finally, a frontier area of research, and a general conclusion of our review, is that community ecology and the long-term evolutionary history of plant and insect diversification are inexorably intertwined.},

abstract = {The Atlantic rainforest in southeastern Brazil is one the main centers of diversification of Bromeliaceae. Empirical estimates of the relative importance of different pre- and postzygotic barriers to gene flow between recently diverged species are important for understanding speciation processes. While many bromeliad species easily hybridize in cultivation, few records of natural hybrids between closely related sympatric species suggest the existence of strong prezygotic barriers. A community of 42 sympatric bromeliad species, represented by nine genera (Aechmea, Billbergia, Edmundoa, Neoregelia, Nidularium, Quesnelia, Racinaea, Tillandsia, and Vriesea), were surveyed from 2004–2005 to assess the role of microhabitat isolation, phenological isolation and ethological isolation as potential prezygotic barriers. These bromeliads are abundant in the understory and frequently grow densely aggregated in multispecific patches that may facilitate promiscuous pollination. There was a large overlap of flowering periods even between congeneric species. Most species shared a similar assemblage of flower visitors; the hummingbird Rhamphodon naevius was the major visitor for 35 species. Only one putative hybrid was observed. This uncommonness of hybridization is puzzling, given that the prezygotic isolation mechanisms investigated are potentially weak to effectively avoid interspecific pollination.},

This previously undetected group was discovered with phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences from the chloroplast trnK (including matK) and trnL introns, and the nuclear ribosomal 5.8S and flanking internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2. All dalbergioids belong to one of three well-supported subclades, the Adesmia, Dalbergia, and Pterocarpus clades. The dalbergioid clade and its three main subclades are cryptic in the sense that they are genetically distinct but poorly, if at all, distinguished by nonmolecular data. Traditionally important taxonomic characters, such as arborescent habit, free stamens, and lomented pods, do not provide support for the major clades identified by the molecular analysis. Short shoots, glandular-based trichomes, bilabiate calyces, and aeschynomenoid root nodules, in contrast, are better indicators of relationship at this hierarchical level. The discovery of the dalbergioid clade prompted a re-analysis of root nodule structure and the subsequent finding that the aeschynomenoid root nodule is synapomorphic for the dalbergioids.},

abstract = {The composition and successional status of a forest affect carbon storage and net ecosystem productivity, yet it remains unclear whether elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) will impact rates and trajectories of forest succession. We examined how CO2 enrichment (+200 microL CO2/L air differential) affects forest succession through growth and survivorship of tree seedlings, as part of the Duke Forest free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment in North Carolina, USA. We planted 2352 seedlings of 14 species in the low light forest understory and determined effects of elevated CO2 on individual plant growth, survival, and total sample biomass accumulation, an integrator of plant growth and survivorship over time, for six years. We used a hierarchical Bayes framework to accommodate the uncertainty associated with the availability of light and the variability in growth among individual plants. We found that most species did not exhibit strong responses to CO2. Ulmus alata (+21{\%}), Quercus alba (+9.5{\%}), and nitrogen-fixing Robinia pseudoacacia (+230{\%}) exhibited greater mean annual relative growth rates under elevated CO2 than under ambient conditions. The effects of CO2 were small relative to variability within populations; however, some species grew better under low light conditions when exposed to elevated CO2 than they did under ambient conditions. These species include shade-intolerant Liriodendron tulipifera and Liquidambar styraciflua, intermediate-tolerant Quercus velutina, and shade-tolerant Acer barbatum, A. rubrum, Prunus serotina, Ulmus alata, and Cercis canadensis. Contrary to our expectation, shade-intolerant trees did not survive better with CO2 enrichment, and population-scale responses to CO2 were influenced by survival probabilities in low light. CO2 enrichment did not increase rates of sample biomass accumulation for most species, but it did stimulate biomass growth of shade-tolerant taxa, particularly Acer barbatum and Ulmus alata. Our data suggest a small CO2 fertilization effect on tree productivity, and the possibility of reduced carbon accumulation rates relative to today's forests due to changes in species composition.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing (AS) of precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs) from multiexon genes allows organisms to increase their coding potential and regulate gene expression through multiple mechanisms. Recent transcriptome-wide analysis of AS using RNA sequencing has revealed that AS is highly pervasive in plants. Pre-mRNAs from over 60{\%} of intron-containing genes undergo AS to produce a vast repertoire of mRNA isoforms. The functions of most splice variants are unknown. However, emerging evidence indicates that splice variants increase the functional diversity of proteins. Furthermore, AS is coupled to transcript stability and translation through nonsense-mediated decay and microRNA-mediated gene regulation. Widespread changes in AS in response to developmental cues and stresses suggest a role for regulated splicing in plant development and stress responses. Here, we review recent progress in uncovering the extent and complexity of the AS landscape in plants, its regulation, and the roles of AS in gene regulation. The prevalence of AS in plants has raised many new questions that require additional studies. New tools based on recent technological advances are allowing genome-wide analysis of RNA elements in transcripts and of chromatin modifications that regulate AS. Application of these tools in plants will provide significant new insights into AS regulation and crosstalk between AS and other layers of gene regulation.},

We examine how concepts pertaining to the assembly of plant communities can be used to strengthen resistance to invasion in restored communities. Community ecology theory predicts that an invasive species will be unlikely to establish if there is a species with similar traits present in the resident community or if available niches are filled. Therefore, successful restoration efforts should select native species with traits similar to likely invaders and include a diversity of functional traits. The success of trait-based approaches to restoration will depend largely on the diversity of invaders, on the strength of environmental factors and on dispersal dynamics of invasive and native species. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Like the previously available options, the new options of MAFFT can handle hundreds of sequences on a standard desktop computer. We also examined the effect of the number of homologues included in an alignment. For a multiple alignment consisting of approximately 8 sequences with low similarity, the accuracy was improved (2-10 percentage points) when the sequences were aligned together with dozens of their close homologues (E-value {\textless} 10(-5)-10(-20)) collected from a database. Such improvement was generally observed for most methods, but remarkably large for the new options of MAFFT proposed here. Thus, we made a Ruby script, mafftE.rb, which aligns the input sequences together with their close homologues collected from SwissProt using NCBI-BLAST.},

Trait variation is therefore a function of both the phylogenetic and spatial context of species. Here we introduce a method that, within a single framework, estimates the relative roles of spatial and phylogenetic variations in comparative data. The approach requires traits measured across phylogenetic units, e.g. species, the spatial occurrences of those units and a phylogeny connecting them. The method modifies the expected variance of phylogenetically independent contrasts to include both spatial and phylogenetic effects. We illustrate this approach by analysing cross-species variation in body mass, geographical range size and species-typical environmental temperature in three orders of mammals (carnivores, artiodactyls and primates). These species attributes contain highly disparate levels of phylogenetic and spatial signals, with the strongest phylogenetic autocorrelation in body size and spatial dependence in environmental temperatures and geographical range size showing mixed effects. The proposed method successfully captures these differences and in its simplest form estimates a single parameter that quantifies the relative effects of space and phylogeny. We discuss how the method may be extended to explore a range of models of evolution and spatial dependence.},

It is characterized by large samaroid pods with a spiny seed case and an abundance of orange peltate glands covering the leaves and inflorescences. Taxonomic distinctions between some species of Centrolobium have been a source of con- fusion. Here, seven species are recognized: C. robustum , C. microchaete , C. tomentosum , C. ochroxylum , C. sclerophyllum , C. paraense, and C. yavi- zanum . Previously recognized varieties of C. paraense , C. paraense var. paraense and C. paraense var. orinocense, are not maintained. Phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequence data from the internal transcribed spacer region of nuclear ribosomal DNA and the plastid matK gene and trnL-trnF intron and spacer support the monophyly of the genus. Different molecular dating methods indicate that the Centrolobium crown group and lineages found to the west and east of the Andes diverged before the Pleistocene. Divergences between species occurring east of the Andes, particularly in Bolivia and south-eastern Brazil are more recent, but nevertheless unlikely to be explained by Pleistocene climatic changes.},

abstract = {Various evolutionary forces may shape the evolution of traits that influence the mating decisions of males and females. Phenotypic traits that males and females use to judge the species identify of potential mates should evolve in a punctuated fashion, changing significantly at the time of speciation but changing little between speciation events. In contrast, traits experiencing sexual selection or sexually antagonistic interactions are generally expected to change continuously over time because of the directional selection pressures imposed on one sex by the actions of the other. To test these hypotheses, we used spherical harmonic representations of the shapes of male mating structures in reconstructions of the evolutionary tempo of these structures across the history of the Enallagma damselfly clade. Our analyses show that the evolution of these structures is completely consistent with a punctuated model of evolutionary change and a constant evolutionary rate throughout the clade's history. In addition, no interpopulation variation in shape was detected across the range of one species. These results indicate that male mating structures in this genus are used primarily for identifying the species of potential mates and experience little or no selection from intraspecific sexual selection or sexual antagonism. The implications of these results for speciation are discussed.},

abstract = {We used cladistic analysis of chloroplast gene sequences (ndhF and rpl16) to test biogeographic hypotheses in the woody genus Gleditsia. Previous morphological comparisons suggested the presence of two eastern Asian-eastern North American species pairs among the 13 known species, as well as other intra- and inter-continental disjunctions. Results from phylo- genetic analyses, interpreted in light of the amount of sequence divergence observed, led to the following conclusions. First, there is a fundamental division of the genus into three clades, only one of which contains both Asian and North American species. Second, the widespread and polymorphic Asian species, G. japonica, is sister to the two North American species, G. triacanthos and G. aquatica, which themselves are closely related inter se, but are both polymorphic and paraphyletic. Third, the lone South American Gleditsia species, G. amorphoides, forms a clade with two eastern Asian species. Gleditsia thus appears to have only one Asian-North American disjunction and no intercontinental species pairs. Low sequence divergence between G. amorphoides and its closest Asian relatives implicates long-distance dispersal in the origin of this unusual disjunction. Sequence divergence between Asian and North American Gleditsia is much lower than between Asian and North American species of its closest relative, Gymnocladus. Estimates of Asian-North American divergence times for Gymnocladus are in general accordance with fossil data, but estimates for Gleditsia suggest recent divergences that conflict with ages of known North American Gleditsia fossils.},

abstract = {The biogeographical history of the mulberry family (Moraceae) was investigated using phylogenetic inferences from nuclear and chloroplast DNA, molecular dating with multiple fossil calibrations, and independent geological evidence. The Moraceae are centered in the tropics which has invited the hypothesis that the family has Gondwanan origins and extant distribution is the result of vicariance due to the break-up of Gondwana. However, the cosmopolitan distribution of Moraceae suggests a more complicated biogeographical history. The timing and location of Moraceae diversification also bears on the origin of the fig pollination mutualism, a model for the study of coevolution and specialization. Recent molecular dating of pollinating fig wasps suggested that an ancient Gondwanan origin coupled with vicariance and dispersal could account for the present day distribution of the mutualism. Here, we provide the first assessment of this hypothesis based on dating of figs and their relatives. Minimum age estimates suggest that the Moraceae had diversified by at least the mid-Cretaceous and major clades including the figs may have radiated during the Tertiary after the break-up of Gondwanaland. Molecular evidence together with Eurasian fossils suggest that the early diversification of Moraceae in Eurasia and subsequent migration into the southern hemisphere is at least as plausible as the Gondwanan hypothesis. These findings invite a reevaluation of the biogeography of fig pollination and highlight the need for incorporating multiple sources of evidence in biogeographical reconstructions. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Bayesian methods are increasingly being used to estimate divergence times without the restrictive assumption of a global clock. Little is known about their reliability for shallow phylogenies where DNA sequence divergence is low. We analyzed both simulated and real sequences to evaluate dating methods in phylogenies with mid-late Miocene roots. A large number of data sets (5000) with 10 taxa each were simulated under a rate-drift model for trees with 2 topologies (balanced or unbalanced) and with different sets of divergence times (characterized by long or short external branches). Data were analyzed using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in which the prior on divergence times was specified from a birth-death process with species sampling (BDS) or a Dirichlet distribution using the programs MCMCTREE and MULTIDIVTIME. The programs generally performed well on shallow phylogenies, but posterior mean node ages were biased and 95{\%} posterior intervals included true ages in fewer than 95{\%} of trees in some analyses. This typically occurred when the 95{\%} prior interval did not include the true age and/or sequence lengths were {\textless}/= 1 kbp. Widths of posterior intervals were also very dependent on the position of the calibrated node within the tree, particularly when sequences were short. Different divergence times priors within MCMCTREE, MULTIDIVTIME, and BEAST were used to analyze mitochondrial DNA data sets from a Bovid subfamily (the Caprinae) from Asian Laudakia and North African Chalcides lizards. Posterior divergence times were quite sensitive to different BDS priors but less sensitive to different Dirichlet priors. Our study demonstrates the impact of the prior on divergence times in shallow phylogenies and shows that 1) prior intervals on nodes should be assessed as a prerequisite to a dating analysis, 2) {\textgreater}or= 1 kbp of quite rapidly evolving sequence may be required to obtain accurate posterior means and usefully narrow posterior intervals.},

Analysis of simulated data sets reveals the kinds of history that are accessible with a multipopulation analysis. Necessarily, processes associated with older time periods in a phylogeny are more difficult to estimate; and histories with high levels of gene flow are particularly difficult with more than two populations. However, for histories with modest levels of gene flow, or for very large data sets, it is possible to study large complex divergence problems that involve multiple closely related populations or species.},

abstract = {Abstract The present paper reviews advances in the study of two major intercontinental disjunct biogeographic patterns: (i) between Eurasian and western North American deserts with the Mediterranean climate (the Madrean–Tethyan disjunctions); and (ii) between the temperate regions of North and South America (the amphitropical disjunctions). Both disjunct patterns have multiple times of origin. The amphitropical disjunctions have largely resulted from long-distance dispersal, primarily from the Miocene to the Holocene, with available data indicating that most lineages dispersed from North to South America. Results of recent studies on the Mediterranean disjuncts between the deserts of Eurasia and western North America support the multiple modes of origin and are mostly consistent with hypotheses of long-distance dispersal and the North Atlantic migration. Axelrod's Madrean–Tethyan hypothesis, which implies vicariance between the two regions in the early Tertiary, has been favored by a few studies. The Beringian migration corridor for semiarid taxa is also supported in some cases.},

The 780-cm depth core was analyzed at 2-cm intervals and arboreal pollen frequencies were compared to nearby speleothem stable isotope records and neighboring marine records from the tropical Atlantic. To evaluate regional versus global climate forcing, our record was compared with Greenland and Antarctic ice-core records. These comparisons suggest that changes in temperature seen in polar latitudes relate to moisture changes: e.g., to changes in the length of the dry season, in tropical and subtropical latitudes during glacial as well as interglacial times. These climatic changes result from changes in the frequency of polar air incursions to these latitudes inducing a permanent cloud cover and precipitation. This is an important result that should help define paleoclimatic features in the Southern Hemisphere for the last glaciation. ?? 2005 University of Washington. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The pollination biology of Aechmea pectinata (Bromeliaceae) was studied in a submontane rainforest in south-eastern Brazil. This species has a mainly clumped distribution and its aggregated individuals are likely to be clones. From October to January, during the flowering period, the distal third of its leaves becomes red. The inflorescence produces 1-15 flowers per day over a period of 20-25 d. The flowers are inconspicuous, greenish-white coloured, tubular shaped with a narrow opening, and the stigma is situated just above the anthers. Anthesis begins at 0400 h and flowers last for about 13 h. The highest nectar volume and sugar concentration occur between 0600 and 1000 h, and decrease throughout the day. Aechmea pectinata is self-incompatible and therefore pollinator-dependent. Hummingbirds are its main pollinators (about 90 {\%} of the visits), visiting flowers mainly in the morning. There is a positive correlation between the number of hummingbird visits per inflorescence and the production of nectar, suggesting that the availability of this resource is important in attracting and maintaining visitors. The arrangement of the floral structures favours pollen deposition on the bill of the hummingbirds. Flowers in clumps promote hummingbird territoriality, and a consequence is self-pollination in a broader sense (geitonogamy) as individuals in assemblages are genetically close. However, trap-lining and intruding hummingbirds promote cross-pollination. These observations suggest that successful fruit set of A. pectinata depends on both the spatial distribution of its individuals and the interactions among hummingbirds.},

This study attempts for the first time to comprehensively sample the early-branching clades of this economically and ecologically important legume subfamily and thus to resolve relationships among them. •$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of the plastid matK and trnL intron sequences included 29 genera not yet sampled in matK phylogenies of the Papilionoideae, 11 of which were sampled for DNA sequence data for the first time. •$\backslash$n$\backslash$nKEY RESULTS: The comprehensively sampled matK phylogeny better resolved the deep-branching relationships and increased support for many clades within Papilionoideae. The potentially earliest-branching papilionoid clade does not include any genus traditionally assigned to tribe Swartzieae. Dipterygeae is monophyletic with the inclusion of Monopteryx. The genera Aldina and Amphimas represent two of the nine main but as yet unresolved lineages comprising the large 50-kb inversion clade within papilionoids. The quinolizidine-alkaloid-accumulating genistoid clade is expanded to include a strongly supported subclade containing Ormosia and the previously unplaced Clathrotropis s.s., Panurea, and Spirotropis. Camoensia is the first-branching genus of the core genistoids. •$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The well-resolved phylogeny of the earliest-branching papilionoids generated in this study will greatly facilitate the efforts to redefine and stabilize the classification of this legume subfamily. Many key floral traits did not often predict phylogenetic relationships, so comparative studies on floral evolution and plant-animal interactions, for example, should also benefit from this study.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Clustering of individuals into populations on the basis of multilocus genotypes is informative in a variety of settings. In population-genetic clustering algorithms, such as BAPS, STRUCTURE and TESS, individual multilocus genotypes are partitioned over a set of clusters, often using unsupervised approaches that involve stochastic simulation. As a result, replicate cluster analyses of the same data may produce several distinct solutions for estimated cluster membership coefficients, even though the same initial conditions were used. Major differences among clustering solutions have two main sources: (1) 'label switching' of clusters across replicates, caused by the arbitrary way in which clusters in an unsupervised analysis are labeled, and (2) 'genuine multimodality,' truly distinct solutions across replicates. RESULTS: To facilitate the interpretation of population-genetic clustering results, we describe three algorithms for aligning multiple replicate analyses of the same data set. We have implemented these algorithms in the computer program CLUMPP (CLUster Matching and Permutation Program). We illustrate the use of CLUMPP by aligning the cluster membership coefficients from 100 replicate cluster analyses of 600 chickens from 20 different breeds.

abstract = {Many early reports of ITS region (ITS 1, 5.8S, and ITS 2) variation in flowering plants indicated that nrDNA arrays within individuals are homogeneous. However, both older and more recent studies have found intra-individual nrDNA polymorphism across a range of plant taxa including presumed non-hybrid diploids. In addition, polymorphic individuals often contain potentially non-functional nrDNA copies (pseudogenes). These findings suggest that complete concerted evolution should not be assumed when embarking on phylogenetic studies using nrDNA sequences. Here we (1) discuss paralogy in relation to species tree reconstruction and conclude that a priori determinations of orthology and paralogy of nrDNA sequences should not be made based on the functionality or lack of functionality of those sequences; (2) discuss why systematists might be particularly interested in identifying and including pseudogene sequences as a test of gene tree sampling; (3) examine the various definitions and characterizations of nrDNA pseudogenes as well as the relative merits and limitations of a subset of pseudogene detection methods and conclude that nucleotide substitution patterns are particularly appropriate for the identification of putative nrDNA pseudogenes; and (4) present and discuss the advantages of a tree-based approach to identifying pseudogenes based on comparisons of sequence substitution patterns from putatively conserved (e.g., 5.8S) and less constrained (e.g., ITS 1 and ITS 2) regions. Application of this approach, through a method employing bootstrap hypothesis testing, and the issues discussed in the paper are illustrated through reanalysis of two previously published matrices. Given the apparent robustness of the test developed and the ease of carrying out percentile bootstrap hypothesis tests, we urge researchers to employ this statistical tool. While our discussion and examples concern the literature on plant systematics, the issues addressed are relevant to studies of nrDNA and other multicopy genes in other taxa. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

While inter-annual fruiting reli- ability remains to be confirmed, fruit production in 1998 and high stem density relative to other study sites provide indirect evidence that Sacoglottis fruits are a reliable inter- annual resource at Petit Loango.

Recently, many studies of local diversity (alpha diversity) have begun to use measures of functional and phylogenetic alpha diversity. Investigations into the phylogenetic and functional dissimilarity (beta diversity) of communities have been far less numerous, but these dissimilarity measures have the potential to infer the mechanisms underlying community assembly and dynamics. Here, we relate levels of phylogenetic and functional alpha diversity to levels of phylogenetic and functional beta diversity to infer the mechanism or mechanisms responsible for the assembly of tree communities in six forests located in tropical and temperate latitudes. The results show that abiotic filtering plays a role in structuring local assemblages and governing spatial turnover in community composition and that phylogenetic measures of alpha and beta diversity are not strong predictors of functional alpha and beta diversity in the forests studied.},

abstract = {Abstract: Small leaves and low specific leaf area (SLA) have long been viewed as adaptations to Mediterranean‐type climates in many species of evergreen woody plants. However, paleobotanical and floristic evidence suggests that in many cases these traits originated prior to the advent of the summer‐drought climate regime. In this study, molecular phylogenies and ancestral state reconstructions were used to test the hypothesis of adaptive leaf evolution in 12 lineages of evergreen shrubs in the California chaparral. Across all lineages there was a small but significant shift toward lower SLA, but there were no trends in leaf size evolution. For individual lineages, adaptive changes were detected in only three cases for SLA and in one case for leaf size. Three of these cases of evolutionary change were observed in taxa derived from cool temperate ancestors (e.g., Heteromeles). In contrast, most lineages originating from subtropical ancestors exhibited relative stasis in leaf trait evolution (e.g., Ceanothus). The absence of change suggests that ancestors of chaparral taxa had already acquired appropriate traits that contributed to their success under Mediterranean‐type climates. These results illustrate how biogeographic history may influence patterns of trait evolution and adaptation and highlight the contribution of ecological sorting processes to the assembly and functional ecology of regional biotas.},

abstract = {Phylogenetic trees based upon DNA sequence data, when calibrated with a dimension of time, allow inference of: (i) the pattern of accumulation of lineages through time; (ii) the time of origin of monophyletic groups; (iii) when lineages arrived in different geographical areas; (iv) the time of origin of biome-specific morphologies. This gives a powerful new view of the history of biomes that in many cases is not provided by the incomplete plant fossil record. Dated plant phylogenies for angiosperm families such as Leguminoaceae (Fabaceae), Melastomataceae sensu stricto, Annonaceae and Rhamnaceae indicate that long-distance, transoceanic dispersal has played an important role in shaping their distributions, and that this can obscure any effect of tectonic history, previously assumed to have been the major cause of their biogeographic patterns. Dispersal from other continents has also been important in the assembly of the Amazonian rainforest flora and the Australian flora. Comparison of dated biogeographic patterns of plants and animals suggests that recent long-distance dispersal might be more prevalent in plants, which has major implications for community assembly and coevolution. Dated plant phylogenies also reveal the role of past environmental changes on the evolution of lineages in species-rich biomes, and show that recent Plio-Pleistocene diversification has contributed substantially to their current species richness. Because of the critical role of fossils and morphological characters in assigning ages to nodes in phylogenetic trees, future studies must include careful morphological consideration of fossils and their extant relatives in a phylogenetic context. Ideal study systems will be based upon DNA sequence data from multiple loci and multiple fossil calibrations. This allows cross-validation both of age estimates from different loci, and from different fossil calibrations. For a more complete view of biome history, future studies should emphasize full taxon sampling in ecologically important groups, and should focus on geographical areas for which few species-level phylogenies are available, such as tropical Africa and Asia. These studies are urgent because understanding the history of biomes can both inform conservation decisions, and help predict the effects of future environmental changes at a time when biodiversity is being impacted on an unprecedented scale.},

abstract = {In general, individuals who survive to reproduce have genotypes that work relatively well under local conditions. Migrating or dispersing offspring elsewhere is likely to decrease an individual's or its offspring's fitness, not to mention the intrinsic costs and risks of dispersal. Gene flow into a population can counteract gene frequency changes because of selection, imposing a limit on local adaptation. In addition, the migrant flow tends to be higher from densely populated to sparsely populated areas. Thus, although the potential for adaptation might be greatest in poor and sparsely populated environments, gene flow will counteract selection more strongly in such populations. Recent papers, both theoretical and empirical, have clarified the important role of migration in evolution, affecting spatial patterns, species ranges and adaptation to the environment; in particular, by emphasizing the crucial interaction between evolutionary and demographic processes.},

abstract = {Bubble formation in the conduits of woody plants sets a challenge for uninterrupted water transportation from the soil up to the canopy. Freezing and thawing of stems has been shown to increase the number of air-filled (embolized) conduits, especially in trees with large conduit diameters. Despite numerous experimental studies, the mechanisms leading to bubble formation during freezing have not been addressed theoretically. We used classical nucleation theory and fluid mechanics to show which mechanisms are most likely to be responsible for bubble formation during freezing and what parameters determine the likelihood of the process. Our results confirm the common assumption that bubble formation during freezing is most likely due to gas segregation by ice. If xylem conduit walls are not permeable to the salts expelled by ice during the freezing process, osmotic pressures high enough for air seeding could be created. The build-up rate of segregated solutes in front of the ice-water interface depends equally on conduit diameter and freezing velocity. Therefore, bubble formation probability depends on these variables. The dependence of bubble formation probability on freezing velocity means that the experimental results obtained for cavitation threshold conduit diameters during freeze/thaw cycles depend on the experimental setup; namely sample size and cooling rate. The velocity dependence also suggests that to avoid bubble formation during freezing trees should have narrow conduits where freezing is likely to be fast (e.g., branches or outermost layer of the xylem). Avoidance of bubble formation during freezing could thus be one piece of the explanation why xylem conduit size of temperate and boreal zone trees varies quite systematically.},

A phylogeny based on cpDNA matK and trnL-F indicated that multiple Pontica lineages colonised each of SW Eurasia, SE North America, and NE Asia, with little or no speciation within regions thereafter. Therefore, multiple (3-4) Pontica lineages survived the Quaternary in SW Eurasia, in contrast to other Tertiary relict genera. Pontica comprises two major clades, one of which is wholly Eurasian, and paraphyletic with respect to at least some of the remaining 200 species of subgenus Hymenanthes, which are all distributed in SE Asia. The other clade has species from W and SE North America, SW Eurasia, and NE Asia. According to synonymous matK substitution data, the two clades diverged 9-6 million years ago (mya), whereas most divergence within them happened 5-3 mya. Although the phylogeny indicates probable trans-Atlantic migration for one of two America-Eurasia disjunctions in Pontica, the timing supports migration via Beringia for both. ?? 2004 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

However, the ﬂoristic afﬁnities of the different families vary considerably, making generalizations about ﬂoristic composition of the valleys difﬁcult. In Labiatae, the species occurring in the dry valleys are principally from genera with an essentially Andean distribution. In the case of Asclepiadaceae and Acanthaceae, there are signiﬁcant chaco and cerrado elements. Genera and families with an amphitropical distribution show stronger links with the Argentinean ﬂora. Disjunct distributions give only weak support for the Pleistocenic arc thesis. High levels of endemism imply the need for more protected areas.},

The largest single contributor to the present-day spread of seed mass was the divergence between angiosperms and gymnosperms, whereas the widest divergence was between Celastraceae and Parnassiaceae. Wide divergences in seed size were more often associated with divergences in growth form than with divergences in dispersal syndrome or latitude.

For instance, we might expect evolutionary change in adaptive radiations to be driven by the availability of ecological niches. Such evolution has been shown to produce patterns of change that are different from those modelled by the Brownian process. We applied two tests for the assumption of Brownian motion that generally have high power to reject data generated under non-Brownian niche-filling models for the evolution of traits in adaptive radiations. As a case study, we used these tests to explore the evolution of feeding adaptations in two radiations of warblers. In one case, the patterns revealed do not accord with Brownian motion but show characteristics expected under certain niche-filling models.},

abstract = {Species richness varies dramatically among groups of organisms, yet the causes of this variation remain poorly understood. Variation in species-level diversification rates may partially explain differential species richness among clades, but older clades should also be more diverse, because they will have had more time to accumulate species. Surprisingly, studies that have investigated this question have reached dramatically different conclusions: several claim to find no such age-diversity relationship, whereas a recent and more inclusive study reported that clade age and not diversification rate explains the variation in species richness among animal taxa. Here I address the relationship between clade age and species richness using a model-based approach that controls for variation in diversification rates among clades. I find that species richness is effectively independent of clade age in four of five data sets. Even extreme among-clade variation in diversification rates cannot account for the absence of a positive age-diversity relationship in angiosperms, birds, and teleost fishes. I consider two alternative explanations for these results and find that a clade volatility model positing correlated speciation-extinction dynamics does not underlie these patterns. Rather, ecological limits on clade growth, such as geographic area, appear to mediate temporal declines in diversification within higher taxa.},

abstract = {The relative importance of local ecological and larger-scale historical processes in causing differences in species richness across the globe remains keenly debated. To gain insight into these questions, we investigated the assembly of plant diversity in the Cerrado in South America, the world's most species-rich tropical savanna. Time-calibrated phylogenies suggest that Cerrado lineages started to diversify less than 10 Mya, with most lineages diversifying at 4 Mya or less, coinciding with the rise to dominance of flammable C4 grasses and expansion of the savanna biome worldwide. These plant phylogenies show that Cerrado lineages are strongly associated with adaptations to fire and have sister groups in largely fire-free nearby wet forest, seasonally dry forest, subtropical grassland, or wetland vegetation. These findings imply that the Cerrado formed in situ via recent and frequent adaptive shifts to resist fire, rather than via dispersal of lineages already adapted to fire. The location of the Cerrado surrounded by a diverse array of species-rich biomes, and the apparently modest adaptive barrier posed by fire, are likely to have contributed to its striking species richness. These findings add to growing evidence that the origins and historical assembly of species-rich biomes have been idiosyncratic, driven in large part by unique features of regional- and continental-scale geohistory and that different historical processes can lead to similar levels of modern species richness.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen a growth in numerical studies using the comparative method. The method usually involves a comparison of two phenotypes across a range of species or higher taxa, or a comparison of one phenotype with an environmental variable. Objectives of such studies vary, and include assessing whether one variable is correlated with another and assessing whether the regres-sion of one variable on another differs significantly from some expected value. Notable recent studies using statistical methods of this type include Pilbeam and Gould's (1974) regressions of tooth area on several size measurements in mam-mals; Sherman's (1979) test of the relation between insect chromosome numbers and social behavior; Damuth's (1981) investigation of population density and body size in mammals; Martin's (1981) regression of brain weight in mammals on body weight; Givnish's (1982) examination of traits associated with dioecy across the families of angiosperms; and Armstrong's (1983) regressions of brain weight on body weight and basal metabolism rate in mammals. My intention is to point out a serious statistical problem with this approach, a problem that affects all of these studies. It arises from the fact that species are part of a hierarchically structured phylogeny, and thus cannot be regarded for statisti-cal purposes as if drawn independently from the same distribution. This problem has been noticed before, and previous suggestions of ways of coping with it are briefly discussed. The nonindependence can be circumvented in principle if ade-quate information on the phylogeny is available. The information needed to do so and the limitations on its use will be discussed. The problem will be discussed and illustrated with reference to continuous variables, but the same statistical issues arise when one or both of the variables are discrete, in which case the statistical methods involve contingency tables rather than regressions and correlations. THE PROBLEM Suppose that we have examined eight species and wish to know whether their brain size (Y) is proportional to their body size (X).

abstract = {Classical examples indicated rapid evolution to be both rare and largely anthropogenic. As the pace and scale of human disturbance increase, such evolution is becoming more the norm. Genetically based adaptation may underlie successful biological invasions, and may likewise characterize responses in natives to invasives. Recent published studies confirm that natives are adapting morphologically, behaviorally, physiologically and life historically to selection from invasive species. Some of the processes involved are evident in our studies of recent host shifts to invasive plants by native soapberry bugs in North America and Australia. On both continents populations have differentiated extensively in fitness traits. Genetic architecture of these adaptations involves a surprising degree of non-additive variation (epistasis, dominance), a result that in theory may reflect a history of colonization by a small number of individuals followed by population growth. Such "founder-flush" events may unleash extraordinary evolutionary potential, and their importance will be clarified as more studies take advantage of the accidental perturbation experiments that biotic invasions represent. From a conservation standpoint, rapid evolution in natives will present challenges for ecologically appropriate and sustainable management, but at the same time may enhance the capacity of the native community to act in the biological control of invasive species.},

abstract = {Geochemical and modeling studies suggest that the transition from the "greenhouse" state of the Late Eocene to the "icehouse" conditions of the Oligocene 34-33.5 Ma was triggered by a reduction of atmospheric pCO2 that enabled the rapid buildup of a permanent ice sheet on the Antarctic continent. Marine records show that the drop in pCO2 during this interval was accompanied by a significant decline in high-latitude sea surface and deep ocean temperature and enhanced seasonality in middle and high latitudes. However, terrestrial records of this climate transition show heterogeneous responses to changing pCO2 and ocean temperatures, with some records showing a significant time lag in the temperature response to declining pCO2. We measured the $\Delta$47 of aragonite shells of the freshwater gastropod Viviparus lentus from the Solent Group, Hampshire Basin, United Kingdom, to reconstruct terrestrial temperature and hydrologic change in the North Atlantic region during the Eocene-Oligocene transition. Our data show a decrease in growing-season surface water temperatures ({\~{}}10 °C) during the Eocene-Oligocene transition, corresponding to an average decrease in mean annual air temperature of {\~{}}4-6 °C from the Late Eocene to Early Oligocene. The magnitude of cooling is similar to observed decreases in North Atlantic sea surface temperature over this interval and occurs during major glacial expansion. This suggests a close linkage between atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, Northern Hemisphere temperature, and expansion of the Antarctic ice sheets.},

To investigate the phylogenetic relationships among these genera and to explore the evolution of the characteristics of the subfamily, we conducted maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses with nrDNA ITS and three cpDNA intergenic spacers (atpB-rbcL, trnS-trnG and trnL-trnF). The results from cpDNA and combined cpDNA + ITS data sets strongly support the monophyly of Pyroleae as well as a sister relationship between Pyrola and Moneses-Chimaphila, with Orthilia as the basal lineage. The sister-group relationship between Moneses and Chimaphila is supported by a set of synapomorphies, e.g., single flower, colpate pollen, five bundles in the style, straight fruiting pedicel orientation, complete capsule dehiscence, and the basic chromosome number, x = 13. The Moneses-Chimaphila-Pyrola clade is supported by at least one homologous character of pollen in tetrads. Conflicts associated with the phylogenetic position of Orthilia may imply a hybrid origin for it, and therefore further study is needed.},

abstract = {Previous phylogenetic studies in oaks (Quercus, Fagaceae) have failed to resolve the backbone topology of the genus with strong support. Here, we utilize next-generation sequencing of restriction-site associated DNA (RAD-Seq) to resolve a framework phylogeny of a predominantly American clade of oaks whose crown age is estimated at 23-33 million years old. Using a recently developed analytical pipeline for RAD-Seq phylogenetics, we created a concatenated matrix of 1.40 E06 aligned nucleotides, constituting 27,727 sequence clusters. RAD-Seq data were readily combined across runs, with no difference in phylogenetic placement between technical replicates, which overlapped by only 43-64{\%} in locus coverage. 17{\%} (4,715) of the loci we analyzed could be mapped with high confidence to one or more expressed sequence tags in NCBI Genbank. A concatenated matrix of the loci that BLAST to at least one EST sequence provides approximately half as many variable or parsimony-informative characters as equal-sized datasets from the non-EST loci. The EST-associated matrix is more complete (fewer missing loci) and has slightly lower homoplasy than non-EST subsampled matrices of the same size, but there is no difference in phylogenetic support or relative attribution of base substitutions to internal versus terminal branches of the phylogeny. We introduce a partitioned RAD visualization method (implemented in the R package RADami; http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RADami) to investigate the possibility that suboptimal topologies supported by large numbers of loci--due, for example, to reticulate evolution or lineage sorting--are masked by the globally optimal tree. We find no evidence for strongly-supported alternative topologies in our study, suggesting that the phylogeny we recover is a robust estimate of large-scale phylogenetic patterns in the American oak clade. Our study is one of the first to demonstrate the utility of RAD-Seq data for inferring phylogeny in a 23-33 million year-old clade.},

These processes have focused almost exclusively on habitat filtering and competitive exclusion. Recent evidence, however, indicates that facilitation has been important in preserving biodiversity over evolutionary time, with recent lineages conserving the regeneration niches of older, distant lineages. Here we test whether, if facilitation among distant-related species has preserved the regeneration niche of plant lineages, this has increased the phylogenetic diversity of communities. By analyzing a large worldwide database of species, we showed that the regeneration niches were strongly conserved across evolutionary history. Likewise, a phylogenetic supertree of all species of three communities driven by facilitation showed that nurse species facilitated distantly related species and increased phylogenetic diversity.},

The sites chosen were an inselberg (C. parviflora), a range of wet restinga - dry restinga - semideciduous dry forest (C. fluminensis), and a gradient from the sea shore inland with a first sand dune beach ridge - a dry forest - a second beach ridge (C. hilariana). Analyses comprised C and N contents, soluble carbohydrates, soluble nonprotein N compounds and carbon isotope ratios (delta(13)C) in leaves, roots, phloem and wood. Photosynthetic performance was assessed by chlorophyll fluorescence with measurements of instant photosynthetic yield as well as light dependence and potential quantum-use efficiency of photosystem II. The data allow, first, to discuss differences between the ecophysiological performance of C-3- and CAM-species of Clusia. The C-3-species, C. parvifolia, had an overall weaker performance than the two CAM-species, where, however, the effects of mode of photosynthesis may have been overlaid by site conditions. Second, it was studied whether ecophysiological performance relates to patterns of local abundance, which was confirmed by showing that the dominant Clusia species of the restingas, C. hilariana, showed the strongest performance overall. Finally, it was studied whether the ecophysiological performance varied in response to site-dependent gradients of environmental water relations, which was confirmed for functions such as photosynthetic capacity, photoinhibition and solute accumulation of C. hilariana and C. fluminensis in relation to moisture of sites},

abstract = {Phenotypic traits and their associated trade-offs have been shown to have globally consistent effects on individual plant physiological functions1–3, but how these effects scale up to influence competition, a key driver of community assembly in terrestrial vegetation, has remained unclear 4. Here we use growth data from more than 3 million trees in over 140,000 plots across the world to show how three key functional traits—wood density, specific leaf area and maximum height—consistently influence competitive interactions. Fast maximum growth of a species was correlated negatively with its wood density in all biomes, and positively with its specific leaf area in most biomes. Low wood density was also correlated with a low ability to tolerate competition and a low competitive effect on neighbours, while high specific leaf area was correlated with a low competitive effect. Thus, traits generate trade-offs between performance with competition versus performance without competition, a fundamental ingredient in the classical hypothesis that the coexistence of plant species is enabled via differentiation in their successional strategies5. Competition within species was stronger than between species, but an increase in trait dissimilarity between species had little influence in weakening competition. No benefit of dissimilarity was detected for specific leaf area or wood density, and only a weak benefit for maximum height. Our trait- based approach to modelling competition makes generalization possible across the forest ecosystems of the world and their highly diverse species composition.},

abstract = {We discuss and clarify several aspects of applying Felsenstein's (1985, Am. Nat. 125: 1-15) procedures to test for correlated evolution of continuous traits. This is one of several available comparative methods that maps data for phenotypic traits onto an existing phylogenetic tree (derived from independent information). Application of Felsenstein's method does not require an entirely dichotomous topology. It also does not require an assumption of gradual, clocklike character evolution, as might be modeled by Brownian motion. Almost any available information can be used to estimate branch lengths (e.g., genetic distances, divergence times estimated from the fossil record or from molecular clocks, numbers of character changes from a cladistic analysis). However, the adequacy for statistical purposes of any proposed branch lengths must be verified empirically for each phylogeny and for each character. We suggest a simple way of doing this, based on graphical analysis of plots of standardized independent contrasts versus their standard deviations (i.e., the square roots of the sums of their branch lengths). In some cases, the branch lengths and/or the values of traits being studied will require transformation. An example involving the scaling of mammalian home range area is presented. Once adequately standardized, sets of independent contrasts can be analyzed using either linear or nonlinear (multiple) regression. In all cases, however, regressions (or correlations) must be computed through the origin. We also discuss ways of correcting for body size effects and how this relates to making graphical representations of relationships of standardized independent contrasts. We close with a consideration of the types of traits that can be analyzed with independent contrasts procedures and conclude that any (continuous) trait that is inherited from ancestors is appropriate for analysis, regardless of the mechanism of inheritance (e.g., genetic or cultural).},

abstract = {In the last decade, amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) have become one of the most widely used molecular markers to study the genetic structure of natural populations. Most of the statistical methods available to study the genetic structure of populations using AFLPs consider these markers as dominant and are thus unable to distinguish between individuals being heterozygous or homozygous for the dominant allele. Some attempts have been made to treat AFLPs as codominant markers by using AFLP band intensities to infer the most likely genotype of each individual. These two approaches have some drawbacks, the former discarding potentially valuable information and the latter being sometimes unable to correctly assign genotypes to individuals. In this study, we propose an alternative likelihood-based approach, which does not attempt at inferring the genotype of each individual, but rather incorporate the uncertainty about genotypes into a Bayesian framework leading to the estimation of population-specific F(IS) and F(ST) coefficients. We show with simulations that the accuracy of our method is much higher than one using AFLP as dominant markers and is generally close to what would be obtained by using the same number of Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) markers. The method is applied to a data set of four populations of the common vole (Microtus arvalis) from Grisons in Switzerland, for which we obtained 562 polymorphic AFLP markers. Our approach is very general and has the potential to make AFLP markers as useful as SNP data for nonmodel species.},

abstract = {Environmental niche models, which are generated by combining species occurrence data with environmental GIS data layers, are increasingly used to answer fundamental questions about niche evolution, speciation, and the accumulation of ecological diversity within clades. The question of whether environmental niches are conserved over evolutionary time scales has attracted considerable attention, but often produced conflicting conclusions. This conflict, however, may result from differences in how niche similarity is measured and the specific null hypothesis being tested. We develop new methods for quantifying niche overlap that rely on a traditional ecological measure and a metric from mathematical statistics. We reexamine a classic study of niche conservatism between sister species in several groups of Mexican animals, and, for the first time, address alternative definitions of "niche conservatism" within a single framework using consistent methods. As expected, we find that environmental niches of sister species are more similar than expected under three distinct null hypotheses, but that they are rarely identical. We demonstrate how our measures can be used in phylogenetic comparative analyses by reexamining niche divergence in an adaptive radiation of Cuban anoles. Our results show that environmental niche overlap is closely tied to geographic overlap, but not to phylogenetic distances, suggesting that niche conservatism has not constrained local communities in this group to consist of closely related species. We suggest various randomization tests that may prove useful in other areas of ecology and evolutionary biology.},

Here I demonstrate that diversification analyses can be misleading when researchers assume that diversity increases unbounded through time, as is typical in molecular phylogenetic studies. If clade diversity is regulated by ecological factors, then species richness may be independent of clade age and it may not be possible to infer the rate at which diversity arose. This has substantial consequences for the interpretation of many studies that have contrasted rates of diversification among clades and regions. Often, it is possible to estimate the total diversification experienced by a clade but not diversification rate itself. I show that the evidence for ecological limits on diversity in higher taxa is widespread. Finally, I explore the implications of ecological limits for a variety of ecological and evolutionary questions that involve inferences about speciation and extinction rates from phylogenetic data.},

abstract = {Subfamily Ericoideae (Ericaceae) includes 19 genera in five recognized tribes. Relationships involving the deepest nodes have been difficult to resolve, limiting the potential for further cladistic studies within the Ericoideae. The current study analyses six molecular markers using Bayesian, Maximum Likelihood and Maximum Parsimony methods to improve phylogenetic resolution within the Ericoideae. Two large clades were discovered. One clade includes the Phyllodoceae and Bejaria. The sister clade includes the Empetreae + Diplarche, Ericeae, Rhodoreae, and a clade comprised of Bryanthus and Ledothamnus. The current study improves upon the resolution of the phylogeny of the Ericoideae, particularly demonstrating support for the deepest nodes. Based on these results, we propose to retain the Ericeae, expand the Phyllodoceae to include Bejaria, expand the Empetreae to include Diplarche, retain the Rhodoreae (without Diplarche), dismantle the Bejarieae, and construct a new tribe, Bryantheae (Bryanthus and Ledothamnus). ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The study of elevational diversity gradients dates back to the foundation of biogeography. Although elevational patterns of plant and animal diversity have been studied for centuries, such patterns have not been reported for microorganisms and remain poorly understood. Here, in an effort to assess the generality of elevational diversity patterns, we examined soil bacterial and plant diversity along an elevation gradient. To gain insight into the forces that structure these patterns, we adopted a multifaceted approach to incorporate information about the structure, diversity, and spatial turnover of montane communities in a phylogenetic context. We found that observed patterns of plant and bacterial diversity were fundamentally different. While bacterial taxon richness and phylogenetic diversity decreased monotonically from the lowest to highest elevations, plants followed a unimodal pattern, with a peak in richness and phylogenetic diversity at mid-elevations. At all elevations bacterial communities had a tendency to be phylogenetically clustered, containing closely related taxa. In contrast, plant communities did not exhibit a uniform phylogenetic structure across the gradient: they became more overdispersed with increasing elevation, containing distantly related taxa. Finally, a metric of phylogenetic beta-diversity showed that bacterial lineages were not randomly distributed, but rather exhibited significant spatial structure across the gradient, whereas plant lineages did not exhibit a significant phylogenetic signal. Quantifying the influence of sample scale in intertaxonomic comparisons remains a challenge. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that the forces structuring microorganism and macroorganism communities along elevational gradients differ.},

abstract = {Abstract: Explaining the diversity in geographic range sizes among species is a central goal of ecological and evolutionary studies. We tested species age as an explanation of range size variation within a group of understory shrubs in the Neotropics (Psychotria subgenus Psychotria, Rubiaceae). We distinguish between range occupancy (filling an occupied area) and range extent (maximum distances dispersed). We used Bayesian relaxed‐clock dating of molecular sequence data to estimate the relative age of species, and we used species distribution modeling to predict species' potential ranges. If the range sizes of species are limited by time for dispersal, we hypothesize that older species should have (1) larger realized range occupancies and realized range extents than younger species, (2) filled a greater proportion of their potential range occupancies, and (3) colonized a greater proportion of their potential range extents. We found (1) a significant but weak positive relationship between species age versus both realized range occupancy and realized range extent, (2) no relationship between species age and filling of potential range occupancies, but (3) that older species had colonized a significantly greater proportion of their potential range extents than younger species. Our results indicate that a time‐for‐dispersal effect can limit the extent of ranges of species but not necessarily their occupancies. CR - Copyright {\&}{\#}169; 2009 The University of Chicago},

Tree and large shrub species of the savannic element (i.e. cerrado sensu lato) total c.700-1000, of which the great majority are rare: only 300 species occurred at 2.5{\%} of 316 sites surveyed in the main core cerrado area and its southern and western outliers. An oligarchy of 116 species dominates the woody flora, while a total of c.340 species provides the vast majority of the vegetation cover. The cerrado woody flora probably evolved from an ancestral cerradao of endemic species to which were added a large number of species from neighbouring biomes. Multivariate analyses of the results of 376 floristic surveys produced six geographical groups: southern (principally Sao Paulo state); central and south-eastern, and central-western - both subdivisions of the main Planalto core area; far-western; north and north-eastern; and disjunct Amazonian. In addition, another group is linked to the presence of mesotrophic soils and is scattered across a large area of the cerrado region. The explosion of modern highly mechanized agriculture during the last c. 35 years has destroyed the natural vegetation of at least 1.3 million km(2) representing about 66{\%} of the biome'.s area, and continues to expand. Major conservation initiatives to protect biodiversity hotspots and provide a representation of the geographical variation across the biome are urgent.},

abstract = {Species selection as a potential driver of macroevolutionary trends has been relegated to a largely philosophical position in modern evolutionary biology. Fundamentally, species selection is the outcome of heritable differences in speciation and extinction rates among lineages when the causal basis of those rate differences can be decoupled from genotypic (within-population) fitnesses. Here, we discuss the rapidly growing literature on variation in species diversification rates as inferred from molecular phylogenies. We argue that modern studies of diversification rates demonstrate that species selection is an important process influencing both the evolution of biological diversity and distributions of phenotypic traits within higher taxa. Explicit recognition of multi-level selection refocuses our attention on the mechanisms by which traits influence speciation and extinction rates. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Frugivorous and insectivorous birds are important components of tropical ecosystems, such as restinga. To provide more information regarding the ecology of restinga, we studied the feeding behavior and spatial use of this vegetation by birds at Restinga de Jurubatiba National Park, southeastern Brazil. We found that feeding behavior was similar to that recorded for the same species in other vegetation types. In addition, spatial use of the restinga vegetation by the most abundant species did not overlap greatly, except for two insectivorous species that used different foraging maneuvers and two frugivorous birds that foraged in flocks. The two most abundant species were generalists in their diet and were capable of feeding at the ground level on sand substrate.},

While empirical evidence for inbreeding depression is vastly greater than that for outbreeding depression, the available data suggest that risks of outbreeding, particularly in the second generation, are on par with the risks of inbreeding. Predicting the relative risks in any particular situation is complicated by variation among taxa, characters being measured, level of divergence between hybridizing populations, mating history, environmental conditions and the potential for inbreeding and outbreeding effects to be occurring simultaneously. Further work on consequences of interpopulation hybridization is sorely needed with particular emphasis on the taxonomic scope, the duration of fitness problems and the joint effects of inbreeding and outbreeding. Meanwhile, managers can minimize the risks of both inbreeding and outbreeding by using intentional hybridization only for populations clearly suffering from inbreeding depression, maximizing the genetic and adaptive similarity between populations, and testing the effects of hybridization for at least two generations whenever possible. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Authors.},

We compared patterns and rates of morphological evolution to investigate whether, in fact, island Anolis are exceptionally diverse relative to their mainland counterparts. Quite the contrary, we found that rates and extent of diversification were comparable--Anolis adaptive radiation is not an island phenomenon. However, mainland and Caribbean anoles occupy different parts of morphological space; in independent colonizations of both island and mainland habitats, island anoles have evolved shorter limbs and better-developed toe pads. These patterns suggest that the two areas are on different evolutionary trajectories. The ecological causes of these differences are unknown, but may relate to differences in predation or competition among mainland and island communities.},

abstract = {The paper provides new and comparative insight into the ecological history of the two largest continental tropical forest areas during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The tropical forest regions are of particular interest because they present a large source of heat and have been shown to have significant impact on the extra tropical atmospheric circulation. They are also the most intense land-based convective centers. Thus, especially from the tropics paleoecological information is needed as benchmarks for climate modeling. The African data for LGM climates were published earlier including the reconstructed paleoprecipitation patterns deduced from SSTs. The tropical South American LGM data were interpreted from pollen, geochemical, and ??18O (stable oxygen isotope) data from Brazil and selected surrounding areas. The available terrestrial data are consistent with the SST derived precipitation data for the tropical forests in Brazil and for Africa. However, the impact of LGM climate extremes was less severe in the Amazon than in the Congo basin. The LGM humid forest area (including evergreen and semi-deciduous forest types) in Africa was probably reduced by 84{\%}. In contrast, the Amazon humid forest area probably shrank to 54{\%} of their present-day extension. Still, there are different interpretations with respect to the amount of reduction of the Amazon forest area during the LGM. Although direct information about LGM climates in Amazonia is still limited the more detailed map obtained in the present work, however, allows a more reliable characterization of the last glacial tropical environment than previously published for the Amazon region. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

However, despite previous morphological and molecular studies, the phylogenetic relationships between the nine currently recognized genera in this clade are still largely unclear, and the widely used infrageneric classification of the genus Hydrangea by McClintock (which was mainly based on the study of herbarium specimens) requires critical reevaluation. We present a partially well resolved and well supported phylogeny of the tribe Hydrangeeae based on maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses of multiple coding and noncoding chloroplast regions ( rps16-trnK spacer, trnK intron, trnK exon, matK gene and trnK-psbA spacer). All genera, sections and subsections were included making it a representative sampling for the tribe Hydrangeeae. Hydrangea is paraphyletic with respect to the eight other genera of Hydrangeeae, requiring a classification update. The subsections Heteromallae and Petalanthe of section Hydrangea are monophyletic, the subsections Americanae , Asperae and Macrophyllae are paraphyletic. Of the two subsections of section Cornidia, one, Polysegia , is monophyletic whereas the other, Monosegia , is paraphyletic. The necessary nomenclatural changes based on these results might have a certain effect in the trade but also might encourage breeders to produce “intergeneric” hybrids between traditionally recognized genera in Hydrangeeae.},

abstract = {Recent phylogenetic studies have revealed the major role played by the uplift of the Andes in the extraordinary diversification of the Neotropical flora. These studies, however, have typically considered the Andean uplift as a single, time-limited event fostering the evolution of highland elements. This contrasts with geological reconstructions indicating that the uplift occurred in discrete periods from west to east and that it affected different regions at different times. We introduce an approach for integrating Andean tectonics with biogeographic reconstructions of Neotropical plants, using the coffee family (Rubiaceae) as a model group. The distribution of this family spans highland and montane habitats as well as tropical lowlands of Central and South America, thus offering a unique opportunity to study the influence of the Andean uplift on the entire Neotropical flora. Our results suggest that the Rubiaceae originated in the Paleotropics and used the boreotropical connection to reach South America. The biogeographic patterns found corroborate the existence of a long-lasting dispersal barrier between the Northern and Central Andes, the "Western Andean Portal." The uplift of the Eastern Cordillera ended this barrier, allowing dispersal of boreotropical lineages to the South, but gave rise to a huge wetland system ("Lake Pebas") in western Amazonia that prevented in situ speciation and floristic dispersal between the Andes and Amazonia for at least 6 million years. Here, we provide evidence of these events in plants.},

The rosid clade diversified rapidly into these major lineages, possibly over a period of {\textless}15 million years, and perhaps in as little as 4 to 5 million years. The timing of the inferred rapid radiation of rosids [108 to 91 million years ago (Mya) and 107-83 Mya for Fabidae and Malvidae, respectively] corresponds with the rapid rise of angiosperm-dominated forests and the concomitant diversification of other clades that inhabit these forests, including amphibians, ants, placental mammals, and ferns.},

A 25 ha (2,500 x 100m) transect was set up from the sea inland, sampling being carried out from 1995 to 1997. The four physiognomic unities that occur in the area were studied and, using the Cover Value Index, the most characteristic species in each formation were determined. 1) Beach Grass Formation: Remirea maritima, Ipomoea imperati, Sporobolus virginicus and Chamaecyse thymifolia; 2) Beach Grass and Shrub Formation: Schinus terebinthifolius, Eugenia sulcata, Pilosocereus arrabidae and Cereus fernambucensis; 3) Clusia Formation: Pera glabrata, Eugenia sulcata, Sideroxylon obtusifolium and Scutia arenicola; 4) Restinga Forest Formation: Maytenus obtusifolia, Pera glabrata, Protium heptaphyllum and Coccoloba alnifolia.

We present a method for reconstructing leaf area index (LAI) based on light-dependent morphology of leaf epidermal cells and phytoliths derived from them. Using this proxy, we reconstruct LAI for the Cenozoic (49 million to 11 million years ago) of middle-latitude Patagonia. Our record shows that dense forests opened up by the late Eocene; open forests and shrubland habitats then fluctuated, with a brief middle-Miocene regreening period. Furthermore, endemic herbivorous mammals show accelerated tooth crown height evolution during open, yet relatively grass-free, shrubland habitat intervals. Our Patagonian LAI record provides a high-resolution, sensitive tool with which to dissect terrestrial ecosystem response to changing Southern Ocean conditions during the Cenozoic.},

abstract = {Few species are likely to be so evident that they will always be detected when present. Failing to allow for the possibility that a target species was present, but undetected, at a site will lead to biased estimates of site occupancy, colonization, and local extinction probabilities. These population vital rates are often of interest in long-term monitoring programs and metapopulation studies. We present a model that enables direct estimation of these parameters when the probability of detecting the species is less than 1. The model does not require any assumptions of process stationarity, as do some previous methods, but does require detection/nondetection data to be collected in a manner similar to Pollock's robust design as used in mark–recapture studies. Via simulation, we show that the model provides good estimates of parameters for most scenarios considered.

In contrast to$\backslash$nprediction from the dry forest refugia hypothesis, the key dry forest$\backslash$nspecies, Anadenanthera colubrina, has only been an important component$\backslash$nof the Bolivian Chiquitano dry forest since the early Holocene, and$\backslash$nappears to have been absent during the last glacial period. Thorn-scrub$\backslash$ncaatinga vegetation probably dominated north-eastern Brazil over most of$\backslash$nthe Late Quaternary period, although it diminished during wetter$\backslash$nintervals, e.g. towards the end of the last glacial period (c.15,500-11,$\backslash$n800 carbon-14 yr BP (18,500-13,800 cal yr BP)), when semi-deciduous dry$\backslash$nforest expanded.

METHOD: Participants included 708 children from the NICHD child care study. Measures of temperament, attention, parent-child relationship, and safety of physical environment were used to predict medically attended injuries. RESULTS: Statistical comparisons among five estimation methods revealed that a zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) model provided the best fit with observed data. ZIP models simultaneously model dichotomous and continuous outcomes of count variables, and different constellations of predictors emerged for each aspect of the estimated model. CONCLUSIONS: This study offers a practical demonstration of techniques designed to handle dependent count variables. The conceptual and statistical advantages of these methods are emphasized, and Stata script is provided to facilitate adoption of these techniques.},

abstract = {If natural communities are assembled according to deterministic rules, coexisting species will represent a nonrandom subset of the potential species pool. We tested for signatures of assembly rules in the distribution of species' traits in Pacific rockfish (Sebastes spp.) assemblages. We used morphology, dietary niche (estimated with stable nitrogen isotopes), and distribution data to identify traits that relate to local-scale resource use (the alpha-niche) and to environmental gradients (the beta-niche). We showed that gill raker morphology was related to trophic position (an alpha-niche axis), while relative eye size was associated with depth habitat (a beta-niche axis). We therefore hypothesized that, within assemblages of coexisting rockfish species, the gill raker trait would be overdispersed (evenly spaced) due to limiting similarity, while relative eye size would be clustered due to environmental filtering. We examined the evolutionary relatedness of coexisting species to ask whether phylogenetic community structure and trait distributions gave similar indications about the roles of assembly processes. We tested the trait distributions and phylogenetic structure of 30 published rockfish assemblages against a null model of random community assembly. As predicted, the gill raker trait tended to be more evenly spaced than expected by chance, as did overall body size, while relative eye size was more clustered than expected. Phylogenetic community structure appeared to reflect historical dispersal and speciation and did not provide consistent support for assembly rules. Our results indicate that rockfish community assembly is nonrandom with regard to species' traits and show how distinguishing traits related to the alpha- and beta-niches and incorporating functional morphology can provide for powerful tests of assembly rules.},

Recently, phylogeographic studies have given support to the existence of previously unknown, or cryptic, refugia. Here we summarise many of these insights into the glacial histories of species in cryptic refugia gained through phylogeographic approaches.

abstract = {Despite a long history of the study of tropical forests, uncertainty about the importance of different ecological processes in shaping tropical tree species distributions persists. Trait- and phylogenetic-based tests of community assembly provide a powerful way to detect community assembly processes but have seldom been applied to the same community. Both methods are well suited to testing how the relative importance of different ecological processes changes with spatial scale. Here we apply both methods to the Yasuni Forest Dynamics Plot, a 25-ha Amazonian forest with {\textgreater}1100 tree species. We found evidence for habitat filtering from both trait and phylogenetic methods from small (25 m(2)) to intermediate (10 000 m(2)) spatial scales. Trait- based methods detected even spacing of strategies, a pattern consistent with niche partitioning or enemy-mediated density dependence, at smaller spatial scales (25-400 m(2)). Simulation modeling of community assembly processes suggests that low statistical power to detect even spacing of traits at larger spatial scales may contribute to the observed patterns. Trait and phylogenetic methods tended to identify the same areas of the forest as being subject to habitat filtering. Phylogenetic community tests, which are far less data-intensive than trait-based methods, captured much of the same. ltering patterns detected by trait-based methods but often failed to detect even-spacing patterns apparent in trait data. Taken together, it appears that both habitat associations and niche differentiation shape species co-occurrence patterns in one of the most diverse forests in the world at a range of small and intermediate spatial scales.},

Both Alaternus, Frangula, and Oreoherzogia gained strong support, and our results further support recognition of Frangula as a monophyletic genus. The resolution between Alaternus, Oreoherzogia, and the rest of Rhamnus s.str. was less clear, and the mainly Mediterranean Oreoherzogia was strongly grouped with the American R. crocea. Therefore, we consider it as unjustified to split the rest of Rhamnus into smaller genera.

abstract = {Seasonally dry tropical forests have been largely ignored in discussions of vegetation changes during the Quaternary. We distinguish dry forests, which are essentially tree-dominated ecosystems, from open savannas that have a xeromorphic fire-tolerant, grass layer and grow on dystrophic, acid soils. Seasonally dry tropical forests grow on fertile soils, usually have a closed canopy, have woody floras dominated by the Leguminosae and Bignoniaceae and a sparse ground flora with few grasses. They occur in disjunct areas throughout the Neotropics. The Chaco forests of central South America experience regular annual frosts, and are considered a subtropical extension of temperate vegetation formations. At least 104 plant species from a wide range of families are each found in two or more of the isolated areas of seasonally dry tropical forest scattered across the Neotropics, and these repeated patterns of distribution suggest a more widespread expanse of this vegeta-tion, presumably in drier and cooler periods of the Pleistocene. We propose a new vegetation model for some areas of the Ice-Age Amazon: a type of seasonally dry tropical forest, with rain forest and montane taxa largely confined to gallery forest. This model is consistent with the distributions of contemporary seasonally dry tropical forest species in Amazonia and existing palynological data. The hypothesis of vicariance of a wider historical area of seasonally dry tropical forests could be tested using a cladistic biogeographic approach focusing on plant genera that have species showing high levels of endemicity in the different areas of these forests.},

abstract = {Community ecologists and conservation biologists often work with data that are too sparse for achieving reliable inference with species-specific approaches. Here we explore the idea of combining species-specific models into a single hierarchical model. The community component of the model seeks for shared patterns in how the species respond to environmental covariates. We illustrate the modeling framework in the context of logistic regression and presence-absence data, but a similar hierarchical structure could also be used in many other types of applications. We first use simulated data to illustrate that the community component can improve parameterization of species-specific models especially for rare species, for which the data would be too sparse to be informative alone. We then apply the community model to real data on 500 diatom species to show that it has much greater predictive power than a collection of independent species-specific models. We use the modeling approach to show that roughly one-third of distance decay in community similarity can be explained by two variables characterizing water quality, rare species typically preferring nutrient-poor waters with high pH, and common species showing a more general pattern of resource use.},

abstract = {The relative importance of biotic, abiotic, and stochastic processes in structuring ecological communities continues to be a central focus in community ecology. In order to assess the role of phylogenetic relatedness on the nature of biodiversity we first quantified the degree of phylogenetic niche conservatism of several plant traits linked to plant form and function. Next we quantified the degree of phylogenetic relatedness across two fundamental scaling dimensions: plant size and neighborhood size. The results show that phylogenetic niche conservatism is likely widespread, indicating that closely related species are more functionally similar than distantly related species. Utilizing this information we show that three of five tropical forest dynamics plots (FDPs) exhibit similar scale-dependent patterns of phylogenetic structuring using only a spatial scaling axis. When spatial- and size-scaling axes were analyzed in concert, phylogenetic overdispersion of co-occurring species was most important at small spatial scales and in four of five FDPs for the largest size class. These results suggest that phylogenetic relatedness is increasingly important: (1) at small spatial scales, where phylogenetic overdispersion is more common, and (2) in large size classes, where phylogenetic overdispersion becomes more common throughout ontogeny. Collectively, our results highlight the critical spatial and size scales at which the degree of phylogenetic relatedness between constituent species influences the structuring of tropical forest diversity.},

abstract = {* 1We sought evidence among the plant species of a New Zealand sand dune community that limiting similarity controls the ability of species to coexist. Sampling was at four spatial scales, from a single point up to a scale of 50 m2. Twenty-three functional characters were measured on each of the species, covering the morphology of the shoot and root systems and nutrient status, and intended to represent modes of resource acquisition. * 2Patterns of association between plant species at the four scales were examined for any tendency for plants with similar functional characters to coexist less often than expected at random (e.g. if a point has three species, do they have notably different characters?) The observed results were compared with the patterns expected under a null model using a range of test statistics. * 3A test over all characters found that the mean dissimilarity between nearest-neighbour species in functional space, and the minimum dissimilarity, were greater than expected under the null model at the 0.5 × 0.5 m scale. This supports the MacArthur {\&} Levins model, although the actual community did not show an even spread of species over functional space. * 4Limiting similarity effects were seen even more consistently in separate characters when within-species variation was taken into account to calculate measures of overlap. The characters involved were mainly those related to rooting patterns and leaf water control, and thus perhaps reflecting the acquisition of nutrients and/or water. * 5Our results seem to be amongst the most convincing support for the theory of limiting similarity, and the only example involving vegetative processes in plant communities. The characters involved suggest that species can more readily coexist if they differ in their water-use pattern, reducing competition between them.},

abstract = {Richard Levins introduced fitness sets as a tool for investigating evolution within heterogeneous environments. Evolutionary game theory permits a synthesis and generalization of this approach by considering the evolutionary response of organisms to any scale of habitat heterogeneity. As scales of heterogeneity increase from fine to coarse, the evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) switches from a single generalist species to several species that become increasingly specialized on distinct habitats. Depending upon the organisms' ecology, the switch from one to two species may occur at high migration rates (relatively fine-grained environment), or may only occur at very low migration rates (coarse-grained environment). At the ESS, the evolutionary context of a species is the entire landscape, while its ecological context may be a single habitat. Evolution towards the ESS can be represented with adaptive landscapes. In the absence of frequency-dependence, shifting from a single strategy ESS to a two strategy ESS poses the problem of evolving across valleys in the adaptive surface to occupy new peaks (hence, Sewell Wright's shifting balance theory). Frequency-dependent processes facilitate evolution across valleys. If a system with a two strategy ESS is constrained to possess a single strategy, the population may actually evolve a strategy that minimizes fitness. Because the population now rests at the bottom of a valley, evolution by natural selection can drive populations to occupy both peaks.},

abstract = {Communities have been shaped in numerous ways by past climatic change; this process continues today. At the end of the Pleistocene epoch about 11,700 years ago, North American communities were substantially altered by the interplay of two events. The climate shifted from the cold, arid Last Glacial Maximum to the warm, mesic Holocene interglacial, causing many mammal species to shift their geographic distributions substantially. Populations were further stressed as humans arrived on the continent. The resulting megafaunal extinction event, in which 70 of the roughly 220 largest mammals in North America (32{\%}) became extinct, has received much attention. However, responses of small mammals to events at the end of the Pleistocene have been much less studied, despite the sensitivity of these animals to current and future environmental change. Here we examine community changes in small mammals in northern California during the last 'natural' global warming event at the Pleistocene-Holocene transition and show that even though no small mammals in the local community became extinct, species losses and gains, combined with changes in abundance, caused declines in both the evenness and richness of communities. Modern mammalian communities are thus depauperate not only as a result of megafaunal extinctions at the end of the Pleistocene but also because of diversity loss among small mammals. Our results suggest that across future landscapes there will be some unanticipated effects of global change on diversity: restructuring of small mammal communities, significant loss of richness, and perhaps the rising dominance of native 'weedy' species.},

A number of studies have addressed this pattern across higher taxa (e.g. 'beetles'), but we know much less about the generality and causal basis of the variation in diversity within evolutionary radiations at lower taxonomic scales. Here, we address the causes of variation in species richness among major lineages of Australia's most diverse vertebrate radiation, a clade of at least 232 species of scincid lizards. We use new mitochondrial and nuclear intron DNA sequences to test the extent of diversification rate variation in this group. We present an improved likelihood-based method for estimating per-lineage diversification rates from combined phylogenetic and taxonomic (species richness) data, and use the method in a hypothesis-testing framework to localize diversification rate shifts on phylogenetic trees. We soundly reject homogeneity of diversification rates among members of this radiation, and find evidence for a dramatic rate increase in the common ancestor of the genera Ctenotus and Lerista. Our results suggest that the evolution of traits associated with climate tolerance may have had a role in shaping patterns of diversity in this group.},

abstract = {1. For plant invaders, being different is often equated with being successful, yet the mechanistic connection remains unclear. 2. Classic niche theory predicts that invaders with niches distinct from the native flora should coexist with little interaction with native species, yet such invaders often have substantial impacts. Meanwhile, invaders that overlap in niche space with native species should either be repelled or dominate, yet these invaders often naturalize with little effect. Such discrepancies between theory and observation raise questions about how species differences influence invader establishment and impact. 3. Here, we review these issues in light of recent work on coexistence theory, which shows how niche and fitness differences between natives and invaders interact to determine invasion outcomes. We show how successful invader establishment depends on either a fitness advantage or niche difference from resident species, but that only the former allows invaders to become dominant. 4. By identifying the role of niche and fitness differences in leading invasion hypotheses, we unify their predictions for invasion success while highlighting new approaches for evaluating the importance of species differences for invasion. 5. Synthesis. Situating the invasion process within a recent coexistence framework broadens our understanding of invasion mechanisms and more tightly links problems in invasion ecology with our more general understanding of community dynamics.},

Current approaches to analyzing hydraulic conductivity (K) data to infer vulnerability to cavitation suffer from problems such as the use of potentially unrealistic vulnerability curves, difficulty interpreting parameters in these curves, a statistical framework that ignores sampling design, and an overly simplistic view of uncertainty. This study illustrates how two common curves (exponential-sigmoid and Weibull) can be reparameterized in terms of meaningful parameters: maximum conductivity (k(sat)), water potential (-P) at which percentage loss of conductivity (PLC) =X{\%} (P(X)), and the slope of the PLC curve at P(X) (S(X)), a 'sensitivity' index. We provide a hierarchical Bayesian method for fitting the reparameterized curves to K(H) data. We illustrate the method using data for roots and stems of two populations of Juniperus scopulorum and test for differences in k(sat), P(X), and S(X) between different groups. Two important results emerge from this study. First, the Weibull model is preferred because it produces biologically realistic estimates of PLC near P = 0 MPa. Second, stochastic embolisms contribute an important source of uncertainty that should be included in such analyses.},

abstract = {SUMMARY The vegetation of the Brazilian sandy coastal plains (‘restingas') consists of vegetation patches of different sizes, separated by bare sand. Clonal growth seems to play an important role in this system, since this patchy resource-poor environment imposes several constraints on the flora. Aechmea nudicaulis and Vriesea neoglutinosa are two bromeliad species that occur in the restinga of Maric{\'{a}}, southeastern Brazil. The clonal growth patterns of these species were studied in order to understand their clonal architecture and ramet growth dynamics. For A. nudicaulis, we mapped six clonal fragments and measured the number of ramets produced by each mother-plant, rhizome length and branching angle. Height and diameter were measured in live plants. For V. neoglutinosa, we measured the number of ramets produced by each mother-plant and the respective branching angles. Leaf number, height, and diameter were recorded over a period of five months. For both species, variation in these parameters was correlated with life stage of the ramets. Clonal fragments of A. nudicaulis concentrate live ramets at the edge of vegetation islands, increasing ramet density. This strategy allows a single clonal fragment to potentially occupy a large area, forming large ramet systems. In contrast, the clonal growth of V. neoglutinosa, with ramets that develop only after sexual reproduction and arise inside the mother-plants, practically without spacer structures, lead to the formation of compact small clonal fragments, retaining their original site of occupation, maintaining the patch size},

Herein, we describe a new method for studying evolutionary rate variation in continuously valued characters given an estimate of the phylogenetic history of the species in our study. According to this method, we propose no specific prior hypothesis for how the variation in evolutionary rate is structured throughout the history of the species in our study. Instead, we use a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to estimate evolutionary rates and the shift point between rates on the tree.We do this by simultaneously sampling rates and shift points in proportion to their posterior probability, and then collapsing the posterior sample into an estimate of the parameters of interest. We use simulation to show that the method is quite successful at identifying the phylogenetic position of a shift in the rate of evolution, and that estimated rates are asymptotically unbiased. We also provide an empirical example of the method using data for Anolis lizards.},

abstract = {Global environmental change is altering the selection regime for all biota. The key selective factors are altered mean, variance and seasonality of climatic variables and increase in CO(2) concentration itself. We review recent studies that document rapid evolution to global climate change at the phenotypic and genetic level, as a response to shifts in these factors. Among the traits that have changed are photoperiod responses, stress tolerance and traits associated with enhanced dispersal. The genetic basis of two traits with a critical role under climate change, stress tolerance and photoperiod behaviour, is beginning to be understood for model organisms, providing a starting point for candidate gene approaches in targeted nonmodel species. Most studies that have documented evolutionary change are correlative, while selection experiments that manipulate relevant variables are rare. The latter are particularly valuable for prediction because they provide insight into heritable change to simulated future conditions. An important gap is that experimental selection regimes have mostly been testing one variable at a time, while synergistic interactions are likely under global change. The expanding toolbox available to molecular ecologists holds great promise for identifying the genetic basis of many more traits relevant to fitness under global change. Such knowledge, in turn, will significantly advance predictions on global change effects because presence and polymorphism of critical genes can be directly assessed. Moreover, knowledge of the genetic architecture of trait correlations will provide the necessary framework for understanding limits to phenotypic evolution; in particular as lack of critical gene polymorphism or entire pathways, metabolic costs of tolerance and linkage or pleiotropy causing negative trait correlations. Synergism among stressor impacts on organismal function may be causally related to conflict among transcriptomic syndromes specific to stressor types. Because adaptation to changing environment is always contingent upon the spatial distribution of genetic variation, high-resolution estimates of gene flow and hybridization should be used to inform predictions of evolutionary rates.},

abstract = {Understanding the genetic consequences of shifting species distributions is critical for evaluating the impact of climate-induced distributional changes. However, the demographic expansion associated with the colonization process typically takes place across a heterogeneous environment, with population sizes and migration rates varying across the landscape. Here we describe an approach for coupling ecological-niche models (ENMs) with demographic and genetic models to explore the genetic consequences of distributional shifts across a heterogeneous landscape. Analyses of a flightless grasshopper from the sky islands of the Rocky Mountains of North America are used to show how biologically informed predictions can be generated about the genetic consequences of a colonization process across a spatially and temporally heterogeneous landscape (i.e. the suitability of habitats for the montane species differs across the landscape and is itself not static, with the displacement of contemporary populations into glacial refugia). By using (i) ENMs for current climatic conditions and the last glacial maximum to (ii) parameterize a demographic model of the colonization process, which then (iii) informs coalescent simulations, a set of models can be generated that capture different processes associated with distributional shifts. We discuss how the proposed approach for model generation can be integrated into a statistical framework for estimating key demographic parameters and testing hypotheses about the conditions for which distributional shifts may (or may not) enhance species divergence, including the importance of habitat stability, past gene-flow among currently isolated populations, and maintenance of refugial populations in multiple geographic regions.},

Moreover, nonrandom structure was greater in homeotherm vs. poikilotherm matrices. Although these analyses do not confirm the mechanisms of Diamond's controversial assembly rules model, they do establish that observed co-occurrence in most natural communities is usually less than expected by chance.

abstract = {The taxonomy of Nyssa (Nyssaceae) in China is confused and uncertain due to differing views about how many species should be recognized, and a scarcity of good morphological differential characters. In the present study, we examined 52 morphological characters from up to fifty accessions each of six of the seven species recognized in the Flora of China: N. yunnanensis, N. javanica, N. sinensis, N. shangszeensis, N. shweliensis and N. wenshanensis. Based on both principal coordinate analysis and UPGMA cluster analysis, N. yunnanensis and N. javanica were both morphologically distinct. However, accessions of N. sinensis, N. shangszeensis, N. shweliensis and N. wenshanensis were intermixed in both analyses and could not be discriminated from each other. Sequence data from nuclear ITS and the chloroplast regions trnH-psbA, rps16r-f, trnL-rps32F, trnS-G and trnL-F were used to further analyze the Nyssa species listed above, together with N. aquatica and N. sylvatica from North America. All analyses of the DNA data using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods strongly supported the monophyly of Nyssa. Within Nyssa, N. yunnanensis and N. javanica were resolved as sister species, which were genetically distinct. The other four Chinese taxa were barely differentiated by molecular data, with only N. shangszeensis and N. wenshanensis weakly supported as monophyletic. Hence, based on morphological and molecular data, we recommend that N. shangszeensis, N. shweliensis and N. wenshanensis be reduced to synonyms of N. sinensis, and only N. sinensis, N. yunnanensis and N. javanica be recognized for Flora of China. The American N. aquatica and N. sylvatica were sister species in the cpDNA but not in the ITS analyses, indicating possible reticulate evolution.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the Chlorophyta--the green algal phylum comprising the classes Prasinophyceae, Ulvophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae and Chlorophyceae--the chloroplast genome displays a highly variable architecture. While chlorophycean chloroplast DNAs (cpDNAs) deviate considerably from the ancestral pattern described for the prasinophyte Nephroselmis olivacea, the degree of remodelling sustained by the two ulvophyte cpDNAs completely sequenced to date is intermediate relative to those observed for chlorophycean and trebouxiophyte cpDNAs. Chlorella vulgaris (Chlorellales) is currently the only photosynthetic trebouxiophyte whose complete cpDNA sequence has been reported. To gain insights into the evolutionary trends of the chloroplast genome in the Trebouxiophyceae, we sequenced cpDNA from the filamentous alga Leptosira terrestris (Ctenocladales). RESULTS: The 195,081-bp Leptosira chloroplast genome resembles the 150,613-bp Chlorella genome in lacking a large inverted repeat (IR) but differs greatly in gene order. Six of the conserved genes present in Chlorella cpDNA are missing from the Leptosira gene repertoire. The 106 conserved genes, four introns and 11 free standing open reading frames (ORFs) account for 48.3{\%} of the genome sequence. This is the lowest gene density yet observed among chlorophyte cpDNAs. Contrary to the situation in Chlorella but similar to that in the chlorophycean Scenedesmus obliquus, the gene distribution is highly biased over the two DNA strands in Leptosira. Nine genes, compared to only three in Chlorella, have significantly expanded coding regions relative to their homologues in ancestral-type green algal cpDNAs. As observed in chlorophycean genomes, the rpoB gene is fragmented into two ORFs. Short repeats account for 5.1{\%} of the Leptosira genome sequence and are present mainly in intergenic regions. CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the great plasticity of the chloroplast genome in the Trebouxiophyceae and indicate that the IR was lost on at least two separate occasions. The intriguing similarities of the derived features exhibited by Leptosira cpDNA and its chlorophycean counterparts suggest that the same evolutionary forces shaped the IR-lacking chloroplast genomes in these two algal lineages.},

abstract = {Maianthemum (Ruscaceae) comprises 28-38 species and includes the two traditionally recognized genera: Maianthemum sensu stricto and Smilacina. Thirty-seven samples representing 22 species of Maianthemum and six closely related outgroup taxa were sequenced for eight chloroplast and nuclear markers (trnL-F, rps16, rpl16, psbA-trnH, rbcL, ndhF, trnK, and ITS) with a total length of nearly 10,000 base pairs. Phylogenetic analyses supported the monophyly of Maianthemum with Maianthemum sensu stricto nested within Smilacina. Almost all species from the eastern Himalayan region in SW China except for Maianthemum tatsienense and M. stenolobum form a well supported clade. This clade is characterized morphologically by short filaments and large anthers, relatively large flowers, and pubescent stems and leaves. Maianthemum tatsienense and M. stenolobum from SW to central China form another clade. The other species from eastern Asia (central to NE China and Japan) and the New World fall into several clades. The intercontinental disjunction between eastern Asia and North America in Maianthemum sensu stricto is estimated to be at 1.68 million years ago (mya) with the Bayesian relaxed clock relying on uncorrelated rates. A recent radiation at about 2.04 mya is suggested in the high mountains of SW China, corresponding to the geographical heterogeneity in that region after the uplift of the Himalayas. Long distance dispersal by birds may have facilitated the evolution of their intercontinental disjunction and their biogeographic diversifications in SW China. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The questions raised centre around (1) the possible mechanisms generating the patterns predicted by my maxent model of community assembly, and (2) the appropriate statistical methods for testing the patterns. Here I briefly explain the proposed mechanistic basis of the model: natural selection occurring between individuals of different species. If trait differences are linked to differential demographic probabilities (i.e. fitness differences) then natural selection will constrain the average trait values found in the community and such average (‘community-aggregated') traits will then possess information that is translated into the maximum entropy probabilities. If community assembly is strictly neutral then the maxent model will have no predictive ability. This also justifies the null model, and the permutation test, proposed by Roxburgh and Mokany.},

abstract = {Understanding the patterns of contemporary, pollen-mediated gene flow is of great importance for designing appropriate conservation strategies. In this study, ten novel polymorphic microsatellite loci were isolated for the rare dioecious tree, Eurycorymbus cavaleriei, and the patterns of pollen dispersal were investigated in an ex situ conserved population. A combination of microsatellite markers with high-collective exclusion power (0.932) was used to assign paternity to 240 seeds collected from eight maternal trees. The average effective pollen dispersal distance (delta) was 292.6 m and the frequency distribution of pollen movement suggested extensive pollen movement in the population. The effective pollen donors per maternal tree (N (ep)) ranged from 5 to 10, and the most isolated maternal trees were observed with the largest number of N (ep) = 10. Although a trend of near-neighbor mating was found in seven of eight maternal trees, no significant correlations were detected between the average effective pollen dispersal distance (delta) and the geographic distances (d1 and d2) between maternal and male trees. The increased average effective distance of pollen dispersal and number of N (ep) for isolated maternal trees might be a compound consequence of low density and long-distance flight of pollinators of this species. The conservation implications of these results are discussed.},

abstract = {Adaptation to a sudden extreme change in environment, beyond the usual range of background environmental fluctuations, is analysed using a quantitative genetic model of phenotypic plasticity. Generations are discrete, with time lag tau between a critical period for environmental influence on individual development and natural selection on adult phenotypes. The optimum phenotype, and genotypic norms of reaction, are linear functions of the environment. Reaction norm elevation and slope (plasticity) vary among genotypes. Initially, in the average background environment, the character is canalized with minimum genetic and phenotypic variance, and no correlation between reaction norm elevation and slope. The optimal plasticity is proportional to the predictability of environmental fluctuations over time lag tau. During the first generation in the new environment the mean fitness suddenly drops and the mean phenotype jumps towards the new optimum phenotype by plasticity. Subsequent adaptation occurs in two phases. Rapid evolution of increased plasticity allows the mean phenotype to closely approach the new optimum. The new phenotype then undergoes slow genetic assimilation, with reduction in plasticity compensated by genetic evolution of reaction norm elevation in the original environment.},

The close associations of the East Asian and western North American species point toward ancient trans-Beringian migrations. Relationships among eastern North American species are poorly resolved and few groups are identified that are congruent with existing classifications. Scant variation and short internal branches among these species suggest rapid divergence associated with polyploidy and hybridization. Incongruence between the chloroplast and nuclear data, and morphology suggest hybrid origins of three species from an extinct European lineage (the male parent) and three different North American female parents.

abstract = {A decision-theoretic approach is used to broaden the fitness set theory of evolution in heterogeneous environments. In previous formulations of fitness set theory, the optimum population always maximized some sort of average fitness across the environmental array with each environment being weighted solely by its actual frequency. An alternative definition of optimum is given in which minimum fitness is maximized instead of average fitness. This Maximin population is also buffered against perturbations in the environmental array (fitness homeostasis) and tends to have equal fitness in most environments (large niche breadth), particularly when the worst conditions the population faces are due to environmental uncertainty. A more generalized definition of optimum takes a mixture of these two above-mentioned populations. In such a mixture optimum, environments are weighted both by their actual frequencies and by their fitness effects. An even weaker definition of optimum is then used to create a set of admissible populations. Theorems are given which show polymorphic populations are not favored on convex fitness sets, but polymorphic optimum populations are possible on concave fitness sets in a fine-grained environment. Furthermore, a generalized adaptive function is found which identifies all possible admissible populations. This adaptive function is generalized further by incorporating a continuous grain parameter which allows not only fine- and coarse-grained environments, but also environments with grain intermediate between fine and coarse and environments with grain coarser than coarse. Many of these results are also extended to the case in which environmental heterogeneity is continuous and not discrete.},

abstract = {Niche conservatism, the tendency of a species niche to remain unchanged over time, is often assumed when discussing, explaining or predicting biogeographical patterns. Unfortunately, there has been no basis for predicting niche dynamics over relevant timescales, from tens to a few hundreds of years. The recent application of species distribution models (SDMs) and phylogenetic methods to analysis of niche characteristics has provided insight to niche dynamics. Niche shifts and conservatism have both occurred within the last 100 years, with recent speciation events, and deep within clades of species. There is increasing evidence that coordinated application of these methods can help to identify species which likely fulfill one key assumption in the predictive application of SDMs: an unchanging niche. This will improve confidence in SDM-based predictions of the impacts of climate change and species invasions on species distributions and biodiversity.*These authors contributed equally. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This study addresses the infrafamilial relationships of Dilleniaceae with nucleotide sequence data from the plastid loci rbcL, infA, rps4, and the rpl16 intron.  Analyses of these data using max. parsimony and Bayesian methods resolve Tetracera, the only pantropical genus in the family, as sister to all other Dilleniaceae.  Within the clade of Dilleniaceae exclusive of Tetracera, the New World endemic genera form a clade that is sister to a clade composed of the Old World endemic genera.  The latter contains two major subclades: (1) a clade contg. Acrotrema, Dillenia, and Schumacheria and (2) a clade contg. Hibbertia and its satellite genera, Adrastaea and Pachynema, which are embedded within Hibbertia.  Ancestral-state reconstructions of six morphol. characters of both biol. and taxonomic significance within Dilleniaceae suggest hypotheses of polarity or lability for each that differ substantially from those based on evolutionary trends.  Perforation plate-type evolution within Dilleniaceae is equivocal, but the large majority of most parsimonious reconstructions suggest that simple perforation plates are plesiomorphic.  Poorly organized leaf venation architecture is synapomorphic for Hibbertia s.l.  Floral morphol. features classically regarded as primitive, such as exceptionally large nos. of stamens (200+) and numerous carpels (more than isomerous with the corolla), are clearly derived within Dilleniaceae and are features of uncommon occurrence within the family as a whole.  Both multicarpellate, synorganized gynoecia and monosym. androecia have multiple origins within the family.  A new classification of Dilleniaceae is outlined, and nomenclatural changes necessitated by the phylogenetic results are provided. [on SciFinder(R)]},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Bromeliads (Bromeliaceae) adapted to rock outcrops or 'inselbergs' in neotropical rain forests have been identified as suitable plant models for studying population divergence and speciation during continental plant radiations. Little is known about genetic relationships and variation in reproductive strategies within and among inselberg-adapted species, yet knowledge of these parameters is important for understanding divergence processes and for conservation planning. METHODS: Nuclear microsatellites were used to assess the role of clonal reproduction, estimate genetic diversity and explore genetic relationships and variation in reproductive strategies for a total of 15 populations of four closely related Alcantarea inselberg species in south-eastern Brazil: A. glaziouana, A. regina, A. geniculata and A. imperialis. KEY RESULTS: Clonal propagation is frequent in coastal populations of A. glaziouana and A. regina, but absent in the high-altitude species A. geniculata and A. imperialis. Considerable variation in clonal diversity, gene diversity (H(e)), allelic richness, and Wright's inbreeding coefficient (F(IS)) exists within and between species of Alcantarea. A Bayesian analysis of coastal inselberg species indicated pronounced genetic structure. A neighbor-joining analysis grouped populations of each species together with moderate bootstrap support, except for the high altitude species A. imperialis. CONCLUSIONS: The coastal inselberg species A. glaziouana and A. regina tend to propagate asexually via vegetative clonal growth, and both reproductive strategies and breeding systems vary greatly between populations and species of Alcantarea. The microsatellite data indicate a history of hybridization and reticulation involving the high-altitude species A. geniculata and A. imperialis in areas of co-occurrence. The results highlight the need to understand similarities and differences in reproductive strategies both within and between related species for conservation planning and as a basis for understanding evolutionary processes in tropical radiations.},

abstract = {The phylogeography of Hymenaea courbaril var. stilbocarpa from Atlantic Forest and riverine forests of the Cerrado biome in central and southeastern Brazil was investigated. The data were compared with those of its congeneric Hymenaea stigonocarpa, a typical tree from savanna. In the Cerrado, H. courbaril var. stilbocarpa is found in sites contiguous with those of H. stigonocarpa, and they share common life-history attributes. The psbC/trnS3 region of the chloroplast DNA was sequenced in 149 individuals of H. courbaril var. stilbocarpa. High genetic variation was found in this species, with the identification of 18 haplotypes, similarly to what was found in H. stigonocarpa with 23 haplotypes in the same geographic region. Populations of H. courbaril var. stilbocarpa could be structured in 3 phylogeographic groups. Spatial analysis of molecular variation indicated that 46.4{\%} of the genetic variation was due to differences among these groups. Three haplotypes were shared by H. courbaril var. stilbocarpa and H. stigonocarpa, and only 10.5{\%} of the total genetic variation could be attributed to between-species difference. We surmise that during the glacial times, H. courbaril var. stilbocarpa populations must have gone extinct in most parts of the southern of its present-day occurrence area. After climate amelioration, these areas were probably recolonized from northern and eastern. The relatively similar phylogeographic structure of vicariant Hymenaea species suggests that they were subjected to the same impacts during the Quaternary climatic fluctuations. The sharing of haplotypes and the genetic similarity between the 2 Hymenaea species suggest the existence of ancestral polymorphism and/or hybridization.},

abstract = {Negative density dependence (NDD) and environmental filtering (EF) shape community assembly, but their relative importance is poorly understood. Recent studies have shown that seedling's mortality risk is positively related to the phylogenetic relatedness of neighbours. However, natural enemies, whose depredations often cause NDD, respond to functional traits of hosts rather than phylogenetic relatedness per se. To understand the roles of NDD and EF in community assembly, we assessed the effects on seedling mortality of functional similarity, phylogenetic relatedness and stem density of neighbouring seedlings and adults in a species-rich tropical forest. Mortality risks increased for common species when their functional traits departed substantially from the neighbourhood mean, and for all species when surrounded by close relatives. This indicates that NDD affects community assembly more broadly than does EF, and leads to the tentative conclusion that natural enemies respond to phylogenetically correlated traits. Our results affirm the prominence of NDD in structuring species-rich communities.},

abstract = {The Malpighiaceae are a family of $\backslash${\~{}}{\{}{\}}1250 species of predominantly New World tropical flowering plants. Infrafamilial classification has long been based on fruit characters. Phylogenetic analyses of chloroplast DNA nucleotide sequences were analyzed to help resolve the phylogeny of Malpighiaceae. A total of 79 species, representing 58 of the 65 currently recognized genera, were studied. The 3' region of the gene ndhF was sequenced for 77 species and the noncoding intergenic spacer region trnL-F was sequenced for 65 species; both sequences were obtained for the outgroup, Humiria (Humiriaceae). Phylogenetic relationships inferred from these data sets are largely congruent with one another and with results from combined analyses. The family is divided into two major clades, recognized here as the subfamilies Byrsonimoideae (New World only) and Malpighioideae (New World and Old World). Niedenzu's tribes are all polyphyletic, suggesting extensive convergence on similar fruit types; only de Jussieu's tribe Gaudichaudieae and Anderson's tribes Acmanthereae and Galphimieae are monophyletic. Fleshy fruits evolved three times in the family and bristly fruits at least three times. Among the wing-fruited vines, which constitute more than half the diversity in the family, genera with dorsal-winged samaras are fairly well resolved, while the resolution of taxa with lateral-winged samaras is poor. The trees suggest a shift from radially symmetrical pollen arrangement to globally symmetrical pollen at the base of one of the clades within the Malpighioideae. The Old World taxa fall into at least six and as many as nine clades.},

abstract = { The possibility to estimate accurately the subsurface electric properties from ground-penetrating radar (GPR) signals using inverse modeling is obstructed by the appropriateness of the forward model describing the GPR subsurface system. In this paper, we improved the recently developed approach of Lambot et al. whose success relies on a stepped-frequency continuous-wave (SFCW) radar combined with an off-ground monostatic transverse electromagnetic horn antenna. This radar configuration enables realistic and efficient forward modeling. We included in the initial model: 1) the multiple reflections occurring between the antenna and the soil surface using a positive feedback loop in the antenna block diagram and 2) the frequency dependence of the electric properties using a local linear approximation of the Debye model. The model was validated in laboratory conditions on a tank filled with a two-layered sand subject to different water contents. Results showed remarkable agreement between the measured and modeled Green's functions. Model inversion for the dielectric permittivity further demonstrated the accuracy of the method. Inversion for the electric conductivity led to less satisfactory results. However, a sensitivity analysis demonstrated the good stability properties of the inverse solution and put forward the necessity to reduce the remaining clutter by a factor 10. This may partly be achieved through a better characterization of the antenna transfer functions and by performing measurements in an environment without close extraneous scatterers.},

abstract = {Understanding how and why certain clades diversify greatly in morphology whereas others do not remains a major theme in evolutionary biology. Projecting families of phylogenies into multivariate morphospaces can distinguish two scenarios potentially leading to unequal morphological diversification: unequal magnitude of change per phylogenetic branch, and unequal efficiency in morphological innovation. This approach is demonstrated using a case study of skulls in sister clades within the South American fish superfamily Anostomoidea. Unequal morphological diversification in this system resulted not from the morphologically diverse clade changing more on each phylogenetic branch, but from that clade distributing an equal amount of change more widely through morphospace and innovating continually. Although substantial morphological evolution occurred throughout the less diverse clade's history, most of that clade's expansion in morphospace occurred in the most basal branches, and more derived portions of that radiation oscillated within previously explored limits. Because simulations revealed that there is a maximum 2.7{\%} probability of generating two clades that differ so greatly in the density of lineages within morphospace under a null Brownian model, the observed difference in pattern likely reflects a difference in the underlying evolutionary process. Clade-specific factors that may have promoted or arrested morphological diversification are discussed.},

abstract = {Phylogenetic analyses of rbcL sequences were used to address both systematic and evolutionary questions posed by the angiosperm family Hydrangeaceae. Our analyses suggest the presence of a monophyletic Hydrangeaceae most closely allied with Loasaceae, a finding in agreement with other molecular as well as morphological analyses. Molecular data indicate that Hydrangeaceae comprise Decumaria, Pileostegia, Schizophragma, Hydrangea, Dichroa, Broussaisia, Platycrater, Cardiandra, Deinanthe, Carpenteria, Philadelphus, Deutzia, Fendlerella, Whipplea, Fendlera, Jamesia, and the enigmatic Kirengeshoma. A particularly close relationship of Kirengeshoma and Deutzia is indicated. Analysis of rbcL sequences suggests that Fendlera and Jamesia are sister to the remainder of the family, lending support to the hypothesis that at least some Carpenterieae are basal in the family and that Hydrangeaceae may have originated in xeric habitats. If this phylogenetic placement of Jamesia and Fendlera is correct, the rbcL trees also suggest that the level of epigyny has decreased in these genera, as well as in the Fendlerella- Whipplea clade and Carpenteria when compared to the outgroup taxa, which are wholly epigynous. Furthermore, the rbcL trees support proposed evolutionary trends in wood anatomy, suggesting, for example, that upland tropical taxa have evolved longer vessel elements with more numerous bars on scalariform perforation plates. The xerophytic basal members of Hydrangeaceae, like the closely related Loasaceae, have short, narrow vessel elements with scalariform perforation plates bearing few bars. Following Jamesia and Fendlera, the remaining hydrangeoids are divided into two large subclades that closely parallel the traditional division of the family into Philadelpheae and Hydrangeae. Both rbcL sequences and morphological data suggest close relationships between: 1) Fendlerella and Whipplea; 2) Decumaria, Pileostegia, and Schizophragma; 3) Carpenteria and Philadelphus; 4) Deinanthe and Cardiandra; 5) Dichroa, Broussaisia, and Hydrangea macrophylla. Molecular and morphological data also concur in demonstrating that the large genus Hydrangea is not a monophyletic assemblage.},

abstract = {Interspecific comparisons of phenotypes are used extensively to test hypotheses about the evolutionary forces shaping phenotypic variation, but comparative data analysis is complicated by correlations due to the common ancestry of species. The method of evolutionary contrasts removes such correlations by estimating the amount of character change between pairs of closely related species that has occurred since their most recent common ancestors. The original method allows character change to be estimated only along pairs of branches on a phylogeny, but many hypotheses address change along single branches. In this article the method of evolutionary contrasts is extended to allow character change along a set of single branches on a phylogeny to be estimated, expected variances are presented, and it is shown that these extensions also result in a set of contrasts that are not correlated because of common ancestry. These extensions will allow hypotheses to be tested concerning character change associated with host or habitat shifts, changes in breeding system (e.g., monogamy vs. polygyny, monoecy vs. dioecy), changes in life history (e.g., semelparity vs. iteroparity), and changes in quantitative characters in many other situations in which one is interested in character change along single branches.},

abstract = {Grasslands cover more than 20{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} of the Earth's terrestrial surface, and their rise to dominance is one of the most dramatic events of biome evolution in Earth history. Grasses possess two main photosynthetic pathways: the C(3) pathway that is typical of most plants and a specialized C(4) pathway that minimizes photorespiration and thus increases photosynthetic performance in high-temperature and/or low-CO(2) environments. C(4) grasses dominate tropical and subtropical grasslands and savannas, and C(3) grasses dominate the world's cooler temperate grassland regions. This striking pattern has been attributed to C(4) physiology, with the implication that the evolution of the pathway enabled C(4) grasses to persist in warmer climates than their C(3) relatives. We combined geospatial and molecular sequence data from two public archives to produce a 1,230-taxon phylogeny of the grasses with accompanying climate data for all species, extracted from more than 1.1 million herbarium specimens. Here we show that grasses are ancestrally a warm-adapted clade and that C(4) evolution was not correlated with shifts between temperate and tropical biomes. Instead, 18 of 20 inferred C(4) origins were correlated with marked reductions in mean annual precipitation. These changes are consistent with a shift out of tropical forest environments and into tropical woodland/savanna systems. We conclude that C(4) evolution in grasses coincided largely with migration out of the understory and into open-canopy environments. Furthermore, we argue that the evolution of cold tolerance in certain C(3) lineages is an overlooked innovation that has profoundly influenced the patterning of grassland communities across the globe.},

abstract = {There is growing recognition that classifying terrestrial plant species on the basis of their function (into 'functional types') rather than their higher taxonomic identity, is a promising way forward for tackling important ecological questions at the scale of ecosystems, landscapes or biomes. These questions include those on vegetation responses to and vegetation effects on, environmental changes (e.g. changes in climate, atmospheric chemistry, land use or other disturbances). There is also growing consensus about a shortlist of plant traits that should underlie such functional plant classifications, because they have strong predictive power of important ecosystem responses to environmental change and/or they themselves have strong impacts on ecosystem processes. The most favoured traits are those that are also relatively easy and inexpensive to measure for large numbers of plant species. Large international research efforts, promoted by the IGBP–GCTE Programme, are underway to screen predominant plant species in various ecosystems and biomes worldwide for such traits. This paper provides an international methodological protocol aimed at standardising this research effort, based on consensus among a broad group of scientists in this field. It features a practical handbook with step-by-step recipes, with relatively brief information about the ecological context, for 28 functional traits recognised as critical for tackling large-scale ecological questions.},

abstract = {Abstract Before the Evolutionary Synthesis, ‘phylogenetic inertia' was associated with theories of orthogenesis, which claimed that organisms possessed an endogenous perfecting principle. The concept in the modern literature dates to Simpson (1944), who used ‘evolutionary inertia' as a description of pattern in the fossil record. Wilson (1975) used ‘phylogenetic inertia' to describe population-level or organismal properties that can affect the course of evolution in response to selection. Many current authors now view phylogenetic inertia as an alternative hypothesis to adaptation by natural selection when attempting to explain interspecific variation, covariation or lack thereof in phenotypic traits. Some phylogenetic comparative methods have been claimed to allow quantification and testing of phylogenetic inertia. Although some existing methods do allow valid tests of whether related species tend to resemble each other, which we term ‘phylogenetic signal', this is simply pattern recognition and does not imply any underlying process. Moreover, comparative data sets generally do not include information that would allow rigorous inferences concerning causal processes underlying such patterns. The concept of phylogenetic inertia needs to be defined and studied with as much care as ‘adaptation'.},

Dioecy (14{\%} of 566 species) was similar to other tropical vegetations and strongly associated with woodiness and entomophily. However, more interestingly, there was an exceptionally high percentage (35{\%}) of dioecious species among the dominant woody plants. This pattern has not been previously reported, and we discuss the extent to which it is ecologically driven.

The extent to which flowering-time response to temperature is shared among closely related species might have important consequences for community-wide patterns of species loss under rapid climate change. Henry David Thoreau initiated a dataset of the Concord, Massachusetts, flora that spans approximately 150 years and provides information on changes in species abundance and flowering time. When these data are analyzed in a phylogenetic context, they indicate that change in abundance is strongly correlated with flowering-time response. Species that do not respond to temperature have decreased greatly in abundance, and include among others anemones and buttercups [Ranunculaceae pro parte (p.p.)], asters and campanulas (Asterales), bluets (Rubiaceae p.p.), bladderworts (Lentibulariaceae), dogwoods (Cornaceae), lilies (Liliales), mints (Lamiaceae p.p.), orchids (Orchidaceae), roses (Rosaceae p.p.), saxifrages (Saxifragales), and violets (Malpighiales). Because flowering-time response traits are shared among closely related species, our findings suggest that climate change has affected and will likely continue to shape the phylogenetically biased pattern of species loss in Thoreau's woods.},

abstract = {The cerrado vegetation of S{\~{a}}o Paulo and neighbouring states occurs under more extreme environ- mental conditions, especially lower temperatures (occasionally with severe frosts), and a shorter dry season than the core area of the biome. As a consequence, these southern cerrados form a distinct phytogeographical region, which can be locally divided into two separate floristic (and physiognomic) groups: (1) areas covered by cerrad{\~{a}}o (associated with more fertile soils) and (2) areas covered by sparser vegetation, e.g. cerrado sensu stricto (associated with very poor and sandy soils). The southern cerrado areas are bordered by the Atlantic forest, which exerts a strong influence on their flora. In recent years, a rapid physiognomic and floristic change has taken place at the southern limits of the cerrado biome, especially in S{\~{a}}o Paulo state: strong protection against fire has caused open-form cerrado vegetation to change into closed cerrad{\~{a}}o. The southern cerrados contain some of the floris- tically richest sites in the cerrado domain and require special protection by conservation strategies},

abstract = {Recent functional trait studies have shown that trait differences may favour certain species (environmental filtering) while simultaneously preventing competitive exclusion (niche partitioning). However, phenomenological trait-dispersion analyses do not identify the mechanisms that generate niche partitioning, preventing trait-based prediction of future changes in biodiversity. We argue that such predictions require linking functional traits with recognised coexistence mechanisms involving spatial or temporal environmental heterogeneity, resource partitioning and natural enemies. We first demonstrate the limitations of phenomenological approaches using simulations, and then (1) propose trait-based tests of coexistence, (2) generate hypotheses about which plant functional traits are likely to interact with particular mechanisms and (3) review the literature for evidence for these hypotheses. Theory and data suggest that all four classes of coexistence mechanisms could act on functional trait variation, but some mechanisms will be stronger and more widespread than others. The highest priority for future research is studies of interactions between environmental heterogeneity and trait variation that measure environmental variables at within-community scales and quantify species' responses to the environment in the absence of competition. Evidence that similar trait-based coexistence mechanisms operate in many ecosystems would simplify biodiversity forecasting and represent a rare victory for generality over contingency in community ecology.},

abstract = {Early flowering plants are thought to have been woody species restricted to warm habitats. This lineage has since radiated into almost every climate, with manifold growth forms. As angiosperms spread and climate changed, they evolved mechanisms to cope with episodic freezing. To explore the evolution of traits underpinning the ability to persist in freezing conditions, we assembled a large species-level database of growth habit (woody or herbaceous; 49,064 species), as well as leaf phenology (evergreen or deciduous), diameter of hydraulic conduits (that is, xylem vessels and tracheids) and climate occupancies (exposure to freezing). To model the evolution of species' traits and climate occupancies, we combined these data with an unparalleled dated molecular phylogeny (32,223 species) for land plants. Here we show that woody clades successfully moved into freezing-prone environments by either possessing transport networks of small safe conduits and/or shutting down hydraulic function by dropping leaves during freezing. Herbaceous species largely avoided freezing periods by senescing cheaply constructed aboveground tissue. Growth habit has long been considered labile, but we find that growth habit was less labile than climate occupancy. Additionally, freezing environments were largely filled by lineages that had already become herbs or, when remaining woody, already had small conduits (that is, the trait evolved before the climate occupancy). By contrast, most deciduous woody lineages had an evolutionary shift to seasonally shedding their leaves only after exposure to freezing (that is, the climate occupancy evolved before the trait). For angiosperms to inhabit novel cold environments they had to gain new structural and functional trait solutions; our results suggest that many of these solutions were probably acquired before their foray into the cold.},

abstract = {Understanding the relationship between diversity and stability requires a knowledge of how species interact with each other and how each is affected by the environment. The relationship is also complex, because the concept of stability is multifaceted; different types of stability describing different properties of ecosystems lead to multiple diversity-stability relationships. A growing number of empirical studies demonstrate positive diversity-stability relationships. These studies, however, have emphasized only a few types of stability, and they rarely uncover the mechanisms responsible for stability. Because anthropogenic changes often affect stability and diversity simultaneously, diversity-stability relationships cannot be understood outside the context of the environmental drivers affecting both. This shifts attention away from diversity-stability relationships toward the multiple factors, including diversity, that dictate the stability of ecosystems.},

We explore some of the problems linked to calibration with fossils, in particular their position on the tree, and emphasize the use Of Multiple calibration points to obtain better estimates. We use a phylogenetic analysis of Betulaceae based on nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences (5S spacer and ITS) as a case study and estimated divergence times within the family using the nonparametric rate smoothing method of Sanderson and five calibration points from the extensive fossil record of this family. To assess the effects of assumptions relating to the positions of key fossils with respect to stem lineages versus crown groups, we calculated age estimates by placing each fossil subsequently on the stem lineage node and crown group node, and then determined the median value of the resulting ten estimates for each node. Using maximum likelihood and DELTRAN and ACCTRAN parsimony branch lengths, we found that the age of the crown group and stem lineage of Betulaceae vary from 115.2 to 130.6 million years and 211.2 to 302.6 million years (Aptian or before). These results are older than current paleobotanical data. We calculated paleobotanical confidence intervals using methods based on the occurrence of fossils on a stratigraphic column and the lengths of the gaps between these occurrences. We apply these methods to the fossil record of Alnus and related extinct genera; however, only in some cases were molecular- and fossil-based age estimates reconciled.},

The inhibition effects of neighbouring trees on seedling survival decreased with increasing phylogenetic distance between them. In a shade-house experiment, we studied seedling survival of eight species on soil collected close to Castanopsis fissa relative to their survival on soil close to their own adult trees, and found that this relative survival rate increased with phylogenetic distance from C. fissa. This phylogenetic signal disappeared when seedlings were planted in fungicide-treated soil. Our results clearly support negative effects of phylogenetically similar neighbouring trees on seedling survival and suggest that these effects are caused by associated host-specific fungal pathogens.},

abstract = {All species are distributed in space, but within limits. What determines these limits through evolutionary time is an important issue that is receiving increased attention (Hoffman and Blows 1994). For instance, paleobiologists have suggested that species' climatic range limits often reveal long-term stasis (Huntley et al. 1989), which presumably reflects stasis in basic ecological traits (e.g., physiologi- cal tolerance to climatic extremes). Stasis in species' borders provides a particularly compelling category of "niche conservatism" -the observation that phylogenetic lineages often seem to retain much the same ecological niche over substantial spans of evolutionary history (Holt and Gaines 1992; Ricklefs and Latham 1992; Holt 1996). There are three basic classes of explanations for niche conservatism, particularly at species bor- ders: an absence of appropriate genetic variation (Bradshaw 1991; Bradshaw and McNeilly 1991); conservative selection, either within populations (Holt and Gaines 1992; Holt 1996) or among populations (Gomulkiewicz and Holt 1995), preventing evolutionary change in the niche; and gene flow swamping local selec- tion (Mayr 1963)},

abstract = {Taxa co-occurring in communities often represent a nonrandom sample, in phenotypic or phylogenetic terms, of the regional species pool. While heuristic arguments have identified processes that create community phylogenetic patterns, further progress hinges on a more comprehensive understanding of the interactions between underlying ecological and evolutionary processes. We created a simulation framework to model trait evolution, assemble communities (via competition, habitat filtering, or neutral assembly), and test the phylogenetic pattern of the resulting communities. We found that phylogenetic community structure is greatest when traits are highly conserved and when multiple traits influence species membership in communities. Habitat filtering produces stronger phylogenetic structure when taxa with derived (as opposed to ancestral) traits are favored in the community. Nearest-relative tests have greater power to detect patterns due to competition, while total community relatedness tests perform better with habitat filtering. The size of the local community relative to the regional pool strongly influences statistical power; in general, power increases with larger pool sizes for communities created by filtering but decreases for communities created by competition. Our results deepen our understanding of processes that contribute to phylogenetic community structure and provide guidance for the design and interpretation of empirical research.},

abstract = {The species richness of 109 amphi-Pacific disjunct genera was examined in eastern Asia and North America. Although the entire flora of eastern Asia contains approximately one-third more species than that of North America, the difference in species richness among disjunct taxa is less. When woody and herbaceous genera are considered separately, the former exhibit a strong diversity bias favouring eastern Asia whereas there is no significant difference in diversity between continents among herbaceous genera. This result is not due to habitat differences between woody and herbaceous genera, because the disjunct herbs inhabit primarily moist forests and woodlands. This result is also not related to relative phylogenetic advancement, even though older major lineages of plants tend to have a predominance of woody taxa. Woody genera are distributed in lower latitudes than herbaceous genera on both continents, and both woody and herbaceous genera are distributed in lower latitudes in eastern Asia than in North America. The North American temperate flora is primarily a relict of a flora formerly more widespread throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Contemporary patterns of diversity suggest that the effects of climate changes ill the late Tertiary were less severe in eastern Asia and promoted diversification, but were more severe in North America and may have caused widespread extinction. The difference in the effect of climate change on diversity in herbaceous and woody lineages reflects the different ecological relationships of species having these contrasting life forms. Clearly, the contemporary floras of eastern Asia and North America bear the imprint of history and emphasize the important interface between ecological relationships and evolutionary responses.

abstract = {We derive a new metric of community similarity that takes into account the phylogenetic relatedness among species. This metric, phylogenetic community dissimilarity (PCD), can be partitioned into two components, a nonphylogenetic component that reflects shared species between communities (analogous to S{\o}rensen' s similarity metric) and a phylogenetic component that reflects the evolutionary relationships among nonshared species. Therefore, even if a species is not shared between two communities, it will increase the similarity of the two communities if it is phylogenetically related to species in the other community. We illustrate PCD with data on fish and aquatic macrophyte communities from 59 temperate lakes. Dissimilarity between fish communities associated with environmental differences between lakes often has a phylogenetic component, whereas this is not the case for macrophyte communities. With simulations, we then compare PCD with two other metrics of phylogenetic community similarity, II(ST) and UniFrac. Of the three metrics, PCD was best at identifying environmental drivers of community dissimilarity, showing lower variability and greater statistical power. Thus, PCD is a statistically powerful metric that separates the effects of environmental drivers on compositional versus phylogenetic components of community structure.},

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing for transcript profiling in plants has revealed that alternative splicing (AS) affects a much higher proportion of the transcriptome than was previously assumed. AS is involved in most plant processes and is particularly prevalent in plants exposed to environmental stress. The identification of mutations in predicted splicing factors and spliceosomal proteins that affect cell fate, the circadian clock, plant defense, and tolerance/sensitivity to abiotic stress all point to a fundamental role of splicing/AS in plant growth, development, and responses to external cues. Splicing factors affect the AS of multiple downstream target genes, thereby transferring signals to alter gene expression via splicing factor/AS networks. The last two to three years have seen an ever-increasing number of examples of functional AS. At a time when the identification of AS in individual genes and at a global level is exploding, this review aims to bring together such examples to illustrate the extent and importance of AS, which are not always obvious from individual publications. It also aims to ensure that plant scientists are aware that AS is likely to occur in the genes that they study and that dynamic changes in AS and its consequences need to be considered routinely.},

Recovered maximum-parsimony and maximum-likelihood phylogenies support monophyly for the Arecoid Line relative to the rest of the family but paraphyly for subfamily Arecoideae and polyphyly for subfamily Ceroxyloideae (sensu Dransfield and Uhl). Tribes Cocoeae, Geonomeae, Hyophorbeae, and Iriarteae and subfamily Phytelephantoideae were identified as monophyletic as were subfamily Phytelephantoideae + Ravenea (tribe Ceroxyleae of Ceroxyloideae), Podococcus (tribe Podococceae of Arecoideae) + Pseudophoenix (tribe Cyclospatheae of Ceroxyloideae), Reinhardtia (tribe Malortieinae) + tribe Cocoeae (both of Arecoideae), and a clade containing all IndoPacific pseudomonomerous genera of tribe Areceae (Arecoideae). A few taxa show spurious resolution with noncoding plastid DNA data but noncoding data are generally congruent with protein-coding data. Biogeographic interpretation suggests a Gondwanan origin for the Arecoid Line with several lineages found on more than one fragment of the former supercontinent and primary diversification in these groups possibly due to continental breakup vicariance. Three groups involving Cocos, Orania, and the IndoPacific clade demonstrate independent dispersals into the IndoPacific region from a Gondwanan origin. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

abstract = {Forests are one of Earth's critical biomes. They have been shown to respond strongly to many of the drivers that are predicted to change natural systems over this century, including climate, introduced species, and other anthropogenic influences. Predicting how different tree species might respond to this complex of forces remains a daunting challenge for forest ecologists. Yet shifts in species composition and abundance can radically influence hydrological and atmospheric systems, plant and animal ranges, and human populations, making this challenge an important one to address. Forest ecologists have gathered a great deal of data over the past decades and are now using novel quantitative and computational tools to translate those data into predictions about the fate of forests. Here, after a brief review of the threats to forests over the next century, one of the more promising approaches to making ecological predictions is described: using hierarchical Bayesian methods to model forest demography and simulating future forests from those models. This approach captures complex processes, such as seed dispersal and mortality, and incorporates uncertainty due to unknown mechanisms, data problems, and parameter uncertainty. After describing the approach, an example by simulating drought for a southeastern forest is offered. Finally, there is a discussion of how this approach and others need to be cast within a framework of prediction that strives to answer the important questions posed to environmental scientists, but does so with a respect for the challenges inherent in predicting the future of a complex biological system.},

Phylogenetic analyses indicated that Physocarpus and Neillia-Stephanandra were strongly supported as monophyletic and suggested that Stephanandra may have originated by hybridization between two lineages of Neillia. Dispersal-vicariance analyses suggested that the most recent common ancestor of Neillieae may have occupied eastern Asia and western North America and that Physocarpus and Neillia-Stephanandra may have been split by an intercontinental vicariance event in the early Miocene. The biogeographic analyses also suggested that species of Neillia and Stephanandra diversified in eastern Asia, whereas in Physocarpus one dispersal event from western North America to eastern Asia occurred. Two divergent types of LEAFY sequences were found in the eastern North American species, P. opulifolius, but only one type was present in each plant. The two types of sequences may represent homeologous genes that originated by hybridization between P. capitatus and P. monogynus, both western North American species.},

The analysis of brain networks is made feasible by the development of new imaging acquisition methods as well as new tools from graph theory and dynamical systems. This review surveys some of these methodological advances and summarizes recent findings on the architecture of structural and functional brain networks. Studies of the structural connectome reveal several modules or network communities that are interlinked by hub regions mediating communication processes between modules. Recent network analyses have shown that network hubs form a densely linked collective called a "rich club," centrally positioned for attracting and dispersing signal traffic. In parallel, recordings of resting and task-evoked neural activity have revealed distinct resting-state networks that contribute to functions in distinct cognitive domains. Network methods are increasingly applied in a clinical context, and their promise for elucidating neural substrates of brain and mental disorders is discussed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAbstract available from the publisher.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAbstract available from the publisher.},

abstract = {We explore patterns of diversification in the plant clades Adoxaceae and Valerianaceae (within Dipsacales), evaluating correlations between biogeographic change (i.e., movements into new areas), morphological change (e.g., the origin of putative key innovations associated with vegetative and reproductive characters), and shifts in rates of diversification. Our findings indicate that rates of diversification in these plants tend to be less tightly correlated with the evolution of morphological innovations but instead exhibit a pronounced correlation with movement into new geographic areas, particularly the dispersal of lineages into new mountainous regions. The interdependence among apparent novelties (arising from their nested phylogenetic distribution) and the correlation between morphological and biogeographic change suggests a complex history of diversification in Dipsacales. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of incorporating biogeographic history in studies of diversification rates and in the study of geographic gradients in species richness. Furthermore, these results argue against a simple deterministic relationship between dispersal and diversification: like other factors that may influence the probability of speciation and/or extinction, the impact of dispersal on diversification rates depends on being in the right place at the right time.},

Reconciled trees allow the history of the gene tree to be visualized and also quantify the relationship between the two trees. The cost of a reconciled tree is the total number of duplications and gene losses required to reconcile a gene tree with its species tree. We describe the use of heuristic searches to find the species tree which yields the reconciled tree with the lowest cost. This method can be used to infer species trees from one or more gene trees.},

abstract = {Phylogenetic analyses of chloroplast DNA sequences, morphology, and combined data have provided consistent support for many of the major branches within the angiosperm clade Dipsacales. Here we use sequences from three mitochondrial loci to test the existing broad scale phylogeny and in an attempt to resolve several relationships that have remained uncertain. Parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian analyses of a combined mitochondrial data set recover trees broadly consistent with previous studies, although resolution and support are lower than in the largest chloroplast analyses. Combining chloroplast and mitochondrial data results in a generally well-resolved and very strongly supported topology but the previously recognized problem areas remain. To investigate why these relationships have been difficult to resolve we conducted a series of experiments using different data partitions and heterogeneous substitution models. Usually more complex modeling schemes are favored regardless of the partitions recognized but model choice had little effect on topology or support values. In contrast there are consistent but weakly supported differences in the topologies recovered from coding and non-coding matrices. These conflicts directly correspond to relationships that were poorly resolved in analyses of the full combined chloroplast-mitochondrial data set. We suggest incongruent signal has contributed to our inability to confidently resolve these problem areas. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

A total of 2,106 trees (dbh = 4.8 cm) were sampled and total basal area was 27.52 m2.ha-1 and species diversity (H') was 3.73 nats (67 dead standing trees were not included). Based on decreasing importance values (VI), the following families and species outstanded: Myrtaceae, Sapotaceae, Annonaceae, Bombacaceae, and Meliaceae; Pouteria coelomatica, Myrciaria floribunda, Oxandra nitida, Chrysophyllum lucentifolium and Aspidosperma parvifolium. Forest structure and species composition vary on the gradient from the ocean landward, forming three dissimilar species groups. Some species were found only in one of these groups and species dominance also differed zonally. It is proposed that the studied community is called "non-flooded forest formation" instead of the traditionally "Myrtaceae forest" or "dry forest", since family and species composition do not allow a more detailed classification.},

abstract = {Neotropical rainforests have a very poor fossil record, making hypotheses concerning their origins difficult to evaluate. Nevertheless, some of their most important characteristics can be preserved in the fossil record: high plant diversity, dominance by a distinctive combination of angiosperm families, a preponderance of plant species with large, smooth-margined leaves, and evidence for a high diversity of herbivorous insects. Here, we report on an approximately 58-my-old flora from the Cerrej{\'{o}}n Formation of Colombia (paleolatitude approximately 5 degrees N) that is the earliest megafossil record of Neotropical rainforest. The flora has abundant, diverse palms and legumes and similar family composition to extant Neotropical rainforest. Three-quarters of the leaf types are large and entire-margined, indicating rainfall {\textgreater}2,500 mm/year and mean annual temperature {\textgreater}25 degrees C. Despite modern family composition and tropical paleoclimate, the diversity of fossil pollen and leaf samples is 60-80{\%} that of comparable samples from extant and Quaternary Neotropical rainforest from similar climates. Insect feeding damage on Cerrej{\'{o}}n fossil leaves, representing primary consumers, is abundant, but also of low diversity, and overwhelmingly made by generalist feeders rather than specialized herbivores. Cerrej{\'{o}}n megafossils provide strong evidence that the same Neotropical rainforest families have characterized the biome since the Paleocene, maintaining their importance through climatic phases warmer and cooler than present. The low diversity of both plants and herbivorous insects in this Paleocene Neotropical rainforest may reflect an early stage in the diversification of the lineages that inhabit this biome, and/or a long recovery period from the terminal Cretaceous extinction.},

abstract = {Identifying loci under natural selection from genomic surveys is of great interest in different research areas. Commonly used methods to separate neutral effects from adaptive effects are based on locus-specific population differentiation coefficients to identify outliers. Here we extend such an approach to estimate directly the probability that each locus is subject to selection using a Bayesian method. We also extend it to allow the use of dominant markers like AFLPs. It has been shown that this model is robust to complex demographic scenarios for neutral genetic differentiation. Here we show that the inclusion of isolated populations that underwent a strong bottleneck can lead to a high rate of false positives. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that it is possible to avoid them by carefully choosing the populations that should be included in the analysis. We analyze two previously published data sets: a human data set of codominant markers and a Littorina saxatilis data set of dominant markers. We also perform a detailed sensitivity study to compare the power of the method using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), SNP, and microsatellite markers. The method has been implemented in a new software available at our website (http://www-leca.ujf-grenoble.fr/logiciels.htm).},

While plot-based species richness patterns on local scales have received much attention, little is currently known about species-based patterns on a regional scale. Using Ellenberg's indicator values for 1802 plant species in central Europe, we assess the patterns in regional species richness with respect to light, water, and mineral nutrient availability - three variables that strongly influence productivity. The results of this analysis are compared to those of published studies on smaller scales leading to the following conclusions: 1. On a regional scale in central Europe there is a hump-shaped relationship between soil nutrient supply and plant species richness within a given biome. 2. The peak in species richness for grasslands and wetlands occurs on nutrient-poor soils, while the peak for forests is on nutrient-rich soils. 3. Gradients in plant productivity controlled by different variables (i.e. water, nutrients, or disturbance) have dissimilar effects on plant species richness.},

This evolution includes gradual trends of warming and cooling driven by tectonic processes on time scales of 10(5) to 10(7) years, rhythmic or periodic cycles driven by orbital processes with 10(4)- to 10(6)-year cyclicity, and rare rapid aberrant shifts and extreme climate transients with durations of 10(3) to 10(5) years. Here, recent progress in defining the evolution of global climate over the Cenozoic Era is reviewed. We focus primarily on the periodic and anomalous components of variability over the early portion of this era, as constrained by the latest generation of deep-sea isotope records. We also consider how this improved perspective has led to the recognition of previously unforeseen mechanisms for altering climate.},

Although the latter method was developed primarily for the comparison of rates among clades, the approach is equally suited for the analysis of evolutionary rate along single or isolated branches.

abstract = {Many efforts to date evolutionary divergences by using a molecular clock have yielded age estimates that are grossly inconsistent with the paleontological evidence. Such discrepancies often are attributed to the inadequacy of the fossil record, but many potential sources of error can affect molecular-based estimates. In this study, we minimize the potential error caused by inaccurate topology and uncertain calibration times by using a well-supported tree, multiple genes, and multiple well-substantiated dates to explore the correspondence between the fossil record and molecular-based age estimates for major clades of tracheophytes. Age estimates varied because of gene effects, codon position, lineage effects, method of inferring branch lengths, and whether or not rate constancy was assumed. However, even methods designed to ameliorate the effects of rate heterogeneity among lineages could not accommodate the substantially slower rates observed in Marattia + Angiopteris and in the tree ferns. Both of these clades of ferns have undergone dramatic decelerations in their rates of molecular evolution and are "molecular living fossils," consistent with their relative morphological stasis for the past 165-200 million years. Similar discrepancies between the fossil record and molecular-based age estimates noted in other studies may also be explained in part by violations of rate constancy among lineages.},

@article{Anderson2011,
abstract = {Summary 1. Ecologists debate the importance of neutral versus niche-based explanations for patterns of species coexistence and whether small-scale data can inform ecological understanding of communities, referred to by McNaughton [Ecological Monographs, 1983, 53, 291] as ‘ecology's cruel dilemma.' Research on phylogenetic relationships, traits and species co-occurrence has attempted to address this topic, with results considerably mixed. 2. We address the hypothesis that plant community assembly is influenced by trait similarity across ecological gradients and this affects mean phylogenetic distance (MPD) of species within sites. We analysed specific leaf area (SLA), maximum plant height and phylogenetic relationships among Serengeti grasses, a system ideally suited to study community assembly because of an ecological gradient in which the dominant plant stress shifts from drought to light competition. 3. Phylogenetic community assembly theory predicts that MPD would be lowest (under-dispersed) at dry sites and greatest (over-dispersed) at sites with higher rainfall. Similarly, theory predicts that low soil nutrient concentrations should filter intolerant species, so that MPD is expected to be under-dispersed at infertile, low-elevation sites and over-dispersed at fertile, higher-elevation sites. However, as gradients of rainfall and soil fertility run counter to one another across the Serengeti, it was unclear how this covariation would influence MPD. 4. Surprisingly, traits showed different evolutionary patterns: SLA displayed convergent evolution while maximum plant height displayed Brownian evolution across the phylogeny. As predicted, statistically under-dispersed assemblages occurred at lower rainfall, infertile sites while statistically over-dispersed assemblages occurred at higher rainfall, fertile sites. However, the pattern across all plots was weak, with most plots showing no statistical pattern of MPD. 5. Multivariate analyses using structural equation modelling, which statistically controlled for covariation among environmental effects, revealed complex direct and indirect effects of environmental variation on MPD, including offsetting direct effects of SLA and maximum plant height due to their different patterns of trait evolution. 6. Synthesis. Spatially counteracting gradients of moisture and soil fertility across the Serengeti, combined with contrasting patterns of trait evolution, obscured the relationship between MPD and any single environmental variable. Our study shows that integrating trait and phylogenetic relationships across ecological gradients yields considerable insight into the ecological mechanisms that determine community composition, but that multivariate techniques may be required to appropriately reveal such patterns.},

abstract = {Aim: Edaphic heterogeneity may be an important driver of population differentiation in the Amazon but remains to be investigated in trees. We compared the phylogeographic structure across the geographic distribution of two Protium (Burseraceae) species with different degrees of edaphic specialization: Protium alvarezianum, an edaphic specialist of white-sand habitat islands; and Protium subserratum, an edaphic generalist found in white sand as well as in more widespread soil types. We predicted that in the edaphic specialist, geographic distance would structure populations more strongly than in the edaphic generalist, and that soil type would not structure populations in the edaphic generalist unless habitat acts as a barrier promoting population differentiation. Location: Tropical rain forests of the Peruvian and Brazilian Amazon, Guyana and French Guiana. Methods: We sequenced 1209—1211 bp of non-coding nuclear ribosomal DNA (internal transcribed spacer and external transcribed spacer) and a neutral low-copy nuclear gene (phytochrome C) from P. subserratum (n = 65, 10 populations) and P. alvarezianum (n = 19, three populations). We conducted a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis, constructed maximum parsimony haplotype networks and assessed population differentiation among groups (soil type or geographic locality) using analysis of molecular variance and spatial analysis of molecular variance. Results: The edaphic specialist exhibited considerable genetic differentiation among geographically distant populations. The edaphic generalist showed significant genetic differentiation between the Guianan and Amazon Basin populations. Within Peru, soil type and not geographic distance explained most of the variation among populations. Non-white-sand populations in Peru exhibited lower haplotype/nucleotide diversity than white-sand populations, were each other's close relatives, and formed an unresolved clade derived from within the white-sand populations. Main conclusions: Geographic distance is a stronger driver of population differentiation in the edaphic specialist than in the generalist. However, this difference did not appear to be related to edaphic generalism per se as adjacent populations from both soil types in the edaphic generalist did not share many haplotypes. Populations of the edaphic generalist in white-sand habitats exhibited high haplotype diversity and shared haplotypes with distant white-sand habitat islands, indicating that they have either efficient long-distance dispersal and/or larger ancestral effective population sizes and thus retain ancestral polymorphisms. These results highlight the importance of edaphic heterogeneity in promoting population differentiation in tropical trees. CR - Copyright {\&}{\#}169; 2013 Wiley},

Most C4 plants are grasses, which dominate tropical and subtropical grasslands and savannas but are conspicuously absent from cold growing season climates. Physiological attributes of C4 photosynthesis have been invoked to explain C4 grass biogeography; however, the pathway evolved exclusively in grass lineages of tropical origin, suggesting that the prevalence of C4 grasses in warm climates could be due to other traits inherited from their non-C4 ancestors. Here we investigate the relative influences of phylogeny and photosynthetic pathway in determining the ecological distributions of C4 grasses in Hawaii. We find that the restriction of C4 grasses to warmer areas is due largely to their evolutionary history as members of a warm-climate grass clade, but that the pathway does appear to confer a competitive advantage to grasses in more arid environments.},

abstract = {Seed size is correlated with a number of other plant attributes, and such correlations are commonly interpreted as adaptations to different life histories. However, seed size is also strongly related to species phylogeny. In the current comparative literature, correlations between trait variation and taxonomic membership are often interpreted as evidence for phylogenetic constraints, and such phylogenetic explanations of variation are presented as alternatives to adaptive explanations. However, phylogenetic patterns of trait variation should not be discussed exclusively in terms of constraints. Neither should phylogenetic and adaptive explanations for Variation be automatically presented as alternatives. Another explanation for similarity among related taxa is phylogenetic niche conservatism (PNC). This process is well known to exist-indeed, it is an inevitable consequence of evolution by natural selection-and is explicitly adaptive. Under PNC, radiation within a lineage is shaped by phylogeny, by the environment, and by competition from other lineages present in the environment. These factors may inhibit divergence within a lineage (hence ''conservatism''), but there are no insuperable obstacles (constraints) to divergence. We have included multiple data sets within one analysis, permitting an assessment of how a given lineage has diverged under different physical conditions or in the presence of different competing lineages. We found that taxonomic membership statistically accounted for the majority of seed size variation within data sets. Differences among data sets were also largely associated with shifts in taxonomic composition. These two findings do not distinguish between phylogenetic constraints and PNC; however, three other features of the data indicate that phylogeny has its effect through niche conservatism at least as much as through constraint. First, within many lineages, divergence of taxa from their lineage means was greater than divergence between different lineages, showing that phylogeny does not absolutely constrain variation. Second, much seed size variation correlated with taxonomic membership was also correlated with growth form and dispersal mode, suggesting a role of niche adaptation in the conservation of sets of traits within lineages. Third, patterns of divergence within some lineages were not always consistent across data sets, pointing to the role of niche divergence in trait divergence, which is the logical complement of PNC. These results indicate that a PNC model of trait evolution provides a better explanation for seed size variation than phylogenetic constraint.},

In flowering plants, the ambiguity of associations between traits and diversification has sparked debate since Darwin's description of angiosperm diversification as an 'abominable mystery'. Recent work has found that diversification is often diversity-dependent, suggesting that species richness depends on geographical area available more than on traits or the time available to accumulate species. Here, we undertake phylogenetic generalized least squares analyses that jointly examine the effects of age, ecoregion area and four ecological traits on diversification in 409 angiosperm families. Area explained the most variation, dwarfing the effect of traits and age, suggesting that diversity-dependent diversification is controlled by ecological limits. Within the context of area, however, traits associated with biotic pollination (zygomorphy) exhibited the greatest effect, possibly through the evolution of specialization.},

abstract = {How numerous tree species can coexist in diverse forest communities is a key question in community ecology. Whereas neutral theory assumes that species are adapted to common field conditions and coexist by chance, niche theory predicts that species are functionally different and coexist because they are specialized for different niches. We integrated biophysical principles into a mathematical plant model to determine whether and how functional plant traits and trade-offs may cause functional divergence and niche separation of tree species. We used this model to compare the carbon budget of saplings across 13 co-occurring dry-forest tree species along gradients of light and water availability. We found that species ranged in strategy, from acquisitive species with high carbon budgets at highest resource levels to more conservative species with high tolerances for both shade and drought. The crown leaf area index and nitrogen mass per leaf area drove the functional divergence along the simulated light gradient, which was consistent with observed species distributions along light gradients in the forest. Stomatal coordination to avoid low water potentials or hydraulic failure caused functional divergence along the simulated water gradient, but was not correlated to observed species distributions along the water gradient in the forest. The trait-based biophysical model thus explains how functional traits cause functional divergence across species and whether such divergence contributes to niche separation along resource gradients.},

abstract = {(Litter accumulation and its effect on seedling recruitment in a Southeast Brazilian tropical forest). Litter directly and indirectly affects germination and development of seedlings through physical and chemical effects, being an important factor in the determination of plant community. The monthly accumulation of litter was studied from November 1996 to Septem- ber 1998 and its relation to climatic factors (such as rainfall, photoperiod and temperature). Also the litter effect on the recruit- ment of seedlings was observed in the Mata de Santa Genebra (22°49?45? S - 47°06?33? W). The correlation between litter accumulation and climatic factors was very weak. Under the canopy, the removal of the litter layer increased seedling emergence. Seedling mortality was very high, even in the rainy season. This can be due possibly by the low light intensity under the canopy.},

abstract = {Big-leaf mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla) is one of the most valuable and overharvested timber trees of tropical America. A description of the organization of genetic variation across its broad range would be useful for management of genetic diversity and for understanding its demographic history. Here we report on a phylogeographic analysis of mahogany based on six polymorphic cpDNA simple sequence repeat loci (cpSSRs) genotyped in 16 populations distributed across the Brazilian Amazon and Mesoamerica (N = 245 individuals). Of the 31 cpDNA haplotypes identified, 15 occurred in Amazonia and 16 in Mesoamerica with no single haplotype shared between the two regions. The populations from Central America showed moderate differentiation (FST = 0.36) while within population genetic diversity was generally high (mean Nei's HE = 0.639). In contrast, the Amazonian populations were strongly differentiated (FST = 0.95) and contained low haplotype diversity (mean HE = 0.176), with the exception of the highly diverse Marajoara population from the Eastern Amazon (HE = 0.925). SAMOVA identified a single Mesoamerican phylogroup and four Amazonian phylogroups, indicating stronger phylogeographic structure within Amazonia. The results demonstrate high levels of cpDNA variation and differentiation of regional S. macrophylla populations, and provide the first evidence of a major phylogeographic break between Mesoamerican and South American mahogany populations.},

abstract = {Seeds with 'imitation arils' appear wholly or partially covered by pulp or aril but actually carry no fleshy material. The mimetic seed hypothesis to explain this phenomenon proposes a parasitic relationship in which birds are deceived into dispersing seeds that resemble bird-dispersed fruits, without receiving a nutrient reward. The hard-seed for grit hypothesis proposes a mutualistic relationship in which large, terrestrial birds swallow the exceptionally hard mimetic seeds as grit for grinding the softer seeds on which they feed. They defecate, dispersing the seeds, and abrade the seed surface, enhancing germination. Any fruit mimicry is incidental. Fruiting trees of Ormosia spp. (Leguminosae: Papilionoideae) were observed to ascertain mechanisms of seed dispersal and the role of seemingly mimetic characteristics of the seeds in that dispersal. Seed predation and seed germination were also examined. Ormosia isthamensis and O. macrocalyx (but not O. bopiensis) deceived arboreally-foraging frugivorous birds into taking their mimetic seeds, although rates of seed dispersal were low. These results are consistent with the mimetic seed hypothesis. On the other hand, the rates of disappearance of seeds from the ground under the Ormosia trees, hardness of the seeds, and enhancement of germination with the abrasion of the seed coat are all consistent with the hard-seed for grit hypothesis.},

abstract = {Numerous ecological and evolutionary processes are thought to play a role in maintaining the high plant species diversity of tropical forests. An understanding of the phylogenetic structure of an ecological community can provide insights into the relative importance of different processes structuring that community. The objectives of this study were to measure the phylogenetic structure of Neotropical forest tree communities in the Forest Dynamics Plot (FDP) on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, to determine how the phylogenetic structure of tree communities varied among spatial scales and habitats within the FDP, and to study the effects of null-model choice on estimates of community phylogenetic structure. We measured community phylogenetic structure for tree species occurring together in quadrats ranging in size from 10 x 10 m to 100 X 100 m in the FDP. We estimated phylogenetic structure by comparing observed phylogenetic distances among species to the distribution of phylogenetic distances for null communities generated using two different null models. A null model that did not maintain observed species occurrence frequencies tended to find nonrandom community phylogenetic structure, even for random data. Using a null model that maintained observed species frequencies in null communities, the average phylogenetic structure of tree communities in the FDP was close to random at all spatial scales examined, but more quadrats than expected contained species that were phylogenetically clustered or overdispersed, and phylogenetic structure varied among habitats. In young forests and plateau habitats, communities were phylogenetically clustered, meaning that trees were more closely related to their neighbors than expected, while communities in swamp and slope habitats were phylogenetically overdispersed, meaning that trees were more distantly related to their neighbors than expected. Phylogenetic clustering suggests the importance of environmental filtering of phylogenetically conserved traits in young forests and plateau habitats, but the phylogenetic overdispersion observed in other habitats has several possible explanations, including variation in the strength of ecological processes among habitats or the phylogenetic history of niches, traits, and habitat associations. Future studies will need to include information on species traits in order to explain the variation in phylogenetic structure among habitats in tropical forests.},

abstract = {Consideration of the scale at which communities are defined both taxonomi-cally and spatially can reconcile apparently contradictory results on the extent to which plants show phylogenetic niche conservatism. In plant communities in north central Florida, we collected species abundances in 55 0.1-ha plots in several state parks. When communities were defined narrowly to include a single phylogenetic lineage, such as Quercus, Pinus, or Ilex, neighbors tended to be less related than expected (phylogenetic overdispersion) or there was no pattern. If the same communities were defined more broadly, such as when all seed plants were included, neighbors tended to be more related than expected (phylogenetic clustering). These results provide evidence that species interactions among close relatives influence community structure, but they also show that niche conservatism is increasingly evident as communities are defined to include greater phylogenetic diversity. We also found that, as the spatial scale is increased to encompass greater environmental heterogeneity, niche conservatism emerges as the dominant pattern. We then examined patterns of trait evolution in relation to trait similarity within communities for 11 functional traits for a single phylo-genetic lineage (Quercus) and for all woody plants. Among the oaks, convergent evolution of traits important for environmental filtering contributes to the observed pattern of phylogenetic overdispersion. At the broader taxonomic scale, traits tend to be conserved, giving rise to phylogenetic clustering. The shift from overdispersion to clustering can be explained by the increasing conservatism of traits at broader phylogenetic scales.},

The phylogenetic position of the eastern North American N. aquatica remains unresolved. Fossil evidence and geological data suggest that the intercontinental disjuncts in Nyssa are ancient. The migration of Nyssa between Eurasia and North America was probably via the North Atlantic land bridges. Its journey into Asia was probably through two pathways: 1) across Europe and western Siberia after the disappearance of the Turgai Strait at the end of the Eocene; and 2) via the shores of the Tethys Seaway. Nyssa became widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere in the Tertiary, but suffered from wide extinctions probably during climatical changes in the late Tertiary and Quaternary.

Traditionally such studies have focused on the species composition of communities, but researchers are becoming increasingly interested in analyzing the phylogenetic composition in the hope of achieving mechanistic insights into community structure. To date many metrics of phylogenetic beta diversity have been published, but few empirical studies have been published. Further inferences made from such phylogenetic studies critically rely on the pattern of trait evolution. The present work provides a study of the phylogenetic dissimilarity of 96 tree communities in India. The work compares and contrasts eight metrics of phylogenetic dissimilarity, considers the role of phylogenetic signal in trait data and shows that environmental distance rather than spatial distance is the best correlate of phylogenetic dissimilarity in the study system.},

abstract = {Habitat fragmentation represents the single most serious threat to the survival of tropical ecosystems. In formulating strategies to counteract the detrimental effects of fragmentation, knowledge of the levels and patterns of genetic diversity within and between natural populations is vital to the establishment of any conservation programme. We utilized polymorphic chloroplast microsatellite markers to analyse genetic diversity in populations of the endangered tropical tree Caesalpinia echinata Lam. representing the entire extant range of the species. Levels of within-population diversity were low, with only two of seven populations studied displaying any variation. The vast majority of the genetic variation was partitioned between geographical regions (36{\%}) and between populations within regions (55{\%}). These levels of genetic structuring, coupled with a calculated pollen-to-seed flow ratio of approximately 6.7:1, suggest that there has been little gene flow between the three major geographical regions over an extended period. Thus, the current tripartite distribution of the species is more consistent with the existence of separate glacial refugia, rather than reflecting any anthropogenic effects.},

abstract = {The present study describes and evaluates the horizontal and vertical structures of a lowland forest fragment on a hillock in the municipality of Silva Jardim, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil (22 degrees 31'56 '' S and 42 degrees 20'46 '' W). Twenty plots (10x2m) totaling 0.5ha were laid out following the slope grade using DBH {\textgreater}= 5cm as the inclusion criterion. A total of 734 individuals were encountered, yielding a total density of 1468 ind./ha and a total basal area of 10783m(2). The richness values (129 species/41 families), Shannon-Wiener diversity (4.22) and equitability (0.87) indices indicated an accentuated floristic heterogeneity and low ecological dominance. Lauraceae, Myrtaceae, Fabaceae and Euphorbiaceae showed the greatest species richness, corroborating other studies that indicated these species as the most representative of Atlantic Forest areas in southeastern Brazil. The species with the greatest importance values (VI) were Aparisthmium cordatum, Guapira opposita, Lacistema pubescens, Xylopia sericea, Tapirira guianensis and Piptocarpha macropoda. The high diversity observed was influenced by earlier anthropogenic actions and by the current successional stage. The forest fragment studied demonstrated closer floristic similarity to areas inventoried in a close-by biological reserve than to fragments dispersed throughout the coastal plain. Similarities in soil type, degree of soil saturation and use-history of forest resources all support these relationships. The fragmented physiognomy of the central lowland in this region and the use-history of the landscape make these small remnant forest areas important in terms of establishing strategies for landscape restoration and species conservation.},

abstract = {Pieris is an eastern Asian (EA)-eastern North American (NA) disjunct genus with P cubensis in the West Indies (WI). In this study, we inferred interspecific relationships using nucleotide sequences of the internal and external transcribed spacer regions of nuclear ribosomal DNA and chloroplast genome (matK, trnL-F, and psbA-trnH). Pieris nana was sister to the rest of Pieris, i.e. Pieris subg. Pieris. The species Of subg. Pieris diverged consecutively in the order of Pieris cubensis, P. swinhoei, P. floribunda, P. phillyreifolia, and P. formosa Plus P japonica. Neither section Phillyreoides nor section Pieris was monophyletic, and P. phillyreifolia of NA was more closely related to two of the EA species (P. formosa and P. japonica) than to the other NA species (P. floribunda). Morphological characters, such as inflorescence position, testa cell shape, and placenta attachment, used to define the sections were hoinoplasious. Dispersal and vicariance analyses suggested that ancestral populations of Pieris were widespread in the composite area of EA, NA, and WI, and two dispersal events may have occurred from the New World to the Old World. Pieris cubensis may have originated as the result of a dispersal event from the composite area of NA and EA during the early diversification of Pieris in the late Eocene.},

abstract = {Simulations suggest that molecular clock analyses can correctly identify the root of a tree even when the clock assumption is severely violated. Clock-based rooting of phylogenies may be particularly useful when outgroup rooting is problematic. Here, we explore relaxed-clock rooting in the Acer/Dipteronia clade of Sapindaceae, which comprises genera of highly uneven species richness and problematic mutual monophyly. Using an approach that does not presuppose rate autocorrelation between ancestral and descendant branches and hence does not require a rooted a priori topology, we analyzed data from up to seven chloroplast loci for some 50 ingroup species. For comparison, we used midpoint and outgroup rooting and dating methods that rely on rooted input trees, namely penalized likelihood, a Bayesian autocorrelated-rates model, and a strict clock. The chloroplast sequences used here reject a single global substitution rate, and the assumption of autocorrelated rates was also rejected. The root was placed between Acer and Dipteronia by all three rooting methods, albeit with low statistical support. Analyses of Acer diversification with a lineage-through-time plot and different survival models, although sensitive to missing data, suggest a gradual decrease in the average diversification rate. The nine North American species of Acer diverged from their nearest relatives at widely different times: eastern American Acer diverged in the Oligocene and Late Miocene; western American species in the Late Eocene and Mid Miocene; and the Acer core clade, including A. saccharum, dates to the Miocene. Recent diversification in North America is strikingly rare compared to diversification in eastern Asia.},

abstract = {In the Bayesian paradigm, a common method for comparing two models is to compute the Bayes factor, defined as the ratio of their respective marginal likelihoods. In recent phylogenetic works, the numerical evaluation of marginal likelihoods has often been performed using the harmonic mean estimation procedure. In the present article, we propose to employ another method, based on an analogy with statistical physics, called thermodynamic integration. We describe the method, propose an implementation, and show on two analytical examples that this numerical method yields reliable estimates. In contrast, the harmonic mean estimator leads to a strong overestimation of the marginal likelihood, which is all the more pronounced as the model is higher dimensional. As a result, the harmonic mean estimator systematically favors more parameter-rich models, an artefact that might explain some recent puzzling observations, based on harmonic mean estimates, suggesting that Bayes factors tend to overscore complex models. Finally, we apply our method to the comparison of several alternative models of amino-acid replacement. We confirm our previous observations, indicating that modeling pattern heterogeneity across sites tends to yield better models than standard empirical matrices.},

abstract = {Charles Darwin's travels on HMS Beagle taught him that islands are an important source of evidence for evolution. Because many islands are young and have relatively few species, evolutionary adaptation and species proliferation are obvious and easy to study. In addition, the geographical isolation of many islands has allowed evolution to take its own course, free of influence from other areas, resulting in unusual faunas and floras, often unlike those found anywhere else. For these reasons, island research provides valuable insights into speciation and adaptive radiation, and into the relative importance of contingency and determinism in evolutionary diversification.},

abstract = {We currently have only a partial understanding of how phylogenetic relationships relate to patterns of community structure, in part because, for most groups of organisms, we do not know the extent to which ecological similarity results from common ancestry. Associations between phylogenetic relatedness and local community structure are particularly interesting for groups in which many species that span a gradient of phylogenetic divergence occur in potential sympatry. We explored the relationship between evolutionary relatedness and current species co-occurrence among the North American wood-warblers (Aves: Parulidae), a group of songbirds known both for its species diversity and for exhibiting high levels of sympatry at breeding sites. Species co-occurrences were derived from North American Breeding Bird Survey transects comprising 160,000 census points distributed across North America. The nested point-within-transect structure of this survey provides an unusual opportunity to remove larger-scale geographical effects on local community composition and thereby consider patterns of co-occurrence only among regionally sympatric pairs of species. We indexed evolutionary relatedness among all pairs of taxa by genetic distances based on long mitochondrial DNA protein-coding sequences. Most regionally sympatric taxon pairs rarely co-occur at local sites, and the most closely related never exhibit high local co-occurrences, as predicted if past or present competitive effects are strongest for these recently separated lineages. Quantile regression shows that, for a subset of taxa, local co-occurrence does increase with time since common ancestry, and that this apparent relaxation of competitive exclusion is strongest for distantly related species that have differentiated in fundamental ecological and behavioral traits, such as terrestrial vs. arboreal foraging. Comparisons against a null model of species co-occurrence further demonstrate that these patterns occur against a background of phylogenetic niche conservatism: across all phylogenetic distances, sympatric species co-occurred at higher rates than expected by chance, a pattern that might stem from a tendency by these species to show conservatism in their selection of similar general habitat types. Considered in concert, these analyses suggest the simultaneous mediation of local community structure by the ecological similarity of closely related species and by trait divergence among a subset of more distant lineages.},

abstract = {A 650-bp portion of the nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer region was sequenced in 47 species of Pinus, representing all recognized subsections of the genus, and 2 species of Picea and Cathaya as outgroups. Parsimony analyses of these length variable sequences were conducted using a manual alignment, 13 different automated alignments, elision of the automated alignments, and exclusion of all alignment ambiguous sites. High and moderately supported clades were consistently resolved across the different analyses, while poorly supported clades were inconsistently recovered. Comparison of the topologies highlights taxa of particularly problematic placement including Pinus nelsonii and P. aristata. Within subgenus Pinus, there is moderate support for the monophyly of a narrowly circumscribed subsect. Pinus (=subsect. Sylvestres) and strong support for a clade of North and Central American hard pines. The Himalayan P. roxburghii may be sister species to these "New World hard pines," which have two well-supported subgroups, subsect. Ponderosae and a clade of the remaining five subsections. The position of subsect. Contortae conflicts with its placement in a chloroplast DNA restriction site study. Within subgenus Strobus there is consistent support for the monophyly of a broadly circumscribed subsect. Strobi (including P. krempfii and a polyphyletic subsect. Cembrae) derived from a paraphyletic grade of the remaining soft pines. Relationships among subsects. Gerardianae, Cembroides, and Balfourianae are poorly resolved. Support for the monophyly of subgenus Pinus and subgenus Strobus is not consistently obtained.},

abstract = {Root vacuolar sequestration is one of the best-conserved plant strategies to cope with heavy metal toxicity. Here we report that zinc (Zn) tolerance in Arabidopsis requires the action of a novel Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) transporter. We show that ZIF2 (Zinc-Induced Facilitator 2) localises primarily at the tonoplast of root cortical cells and is a functional transporter able to mediate Zn efflux when heterologously expressed in yeast. By affecting plant tissue partitioning of the metal ion, loss of ZIF2 function exacerbates plant sensitivity to excess Zn, while its overexpression enhances Zn tolerance. The ZIF2 gene is Zn-induced and an intron retention event in its 5'UTR generates two splice variants (ZIF2.1 and ZIF2.2) encoding the same protein. Importantly, high Zn favours production of the longer ZIF2.2 transcript, which compared to ZIF2.1 confers greater Zn tolerance to transgenic plants by promoting higher root Zn immobilization. We show that the retained intron in the ZIF2 5'UTR enhances translation in a Zn-responsive manner, markedly promoting ZIF2 protein expression under excess Zn. Moreover, Zn regulation of translation driven by the ZIF2.2 5'UTR depends largely on a predicted stable stem loop immediately upstream of the start codon that is lost in the ZIF2.1 5'UTR. Collectively, our findings indicate that alternative splicing controls the levels of a Zn-responsive mRNA variant of the ZIF2 transporter to enhance plant tolerance to the metal ion.},

abstract = {Assessments of plant population dynamics in space and time have depended on dated records of fossil pollen synthesized on a subcontinental scale. Genetic analyses of extant populations have revealed spatial relationships that are indicative of past spatial dynamics, but lack an explicit timescale. Synthesis of these data requires genetic analyses from abundant dated fossil material, and this has hitherto been lacking. Fossil pollen is the most abundant material with which to fill this data gap. Here we report genetic analyses of fossil pollen retrieved from Holtj{\"{a}}rnen postglacial lake sediment in Sweden and show that plastid DNA is recoverable from Scots Pine and Norway spruce pollen grains that are 100 and 10 000 years old. By sequencing clones from two short plastid PCR products and by using multiple controls we show that the ancient sequences were endogenous to the fossil grains. Comparison of ancient sequences and those obtained from an extant population of Scots pine establishes the first genetic link between extant and fossil samples in this species, providing genetic continuity through time. The finding of one common haplotype present in modern, 100-year old and 10 000-year old samples suggests that it may have persisted near Holtj{\"{a}}rnen throughout the postglacial period. This retrieval of ancient DNA from pollen has major implications for plant palaeoecology in conifer species by allowing direct estimates of population dynamics in space and time.},

abstract = {Abstract  Studies on the survival and establishment of seedlings in coastal and lacustrine sand dune systems suggest that nutrient deficiency, lack of moisture, sand accretion, salt spray and predation are probably the most important limiting factors. Seedlings employ both avoidance and tolerance strategies to with-stand the different stresses. For example, seedling recruitment of dune species coincided with periods of high moisture availability and occurred in years with high well distributed rainfall. The seedlings exhibited rapid vertical elongation of roots, avoided moisture stress by leaf rolling, dense hair on leaves, fleshy cotyledonary leaves, and by growing in the shade of nurse plants. A certain proportion of seedlings of all species survived partial burial and showed stimulation of leaf growth, total leaf area, number of tillers and total dry matter. Seedlings of most species could not survive complete burial, however, some species did grow through the sand deposit by an increase in the number of nodes and length of internodes. Plants responded to salt spray by inhibition of seed germination, developing resistance, increase in leaf thickness and reduced uptake of Na and Cl ions. Several characters such as higher vigour of seedlings, larger seed size and seed polymorphism were also of adaptive significance to the species.},

We recognize a common pattern of phylogenetic conservatism in ecological character and highlight the challenges of using phylogenies of partial lineages. We also review phylogenetic approaches to three emergent properties of communities: species diversity, relative abundance distributions, and range sizes. Methodological advances in phylogenetic supertree construction, character reconstruction, null models for community assembly and character evolution, and metrics of community phylogenetic structure underlie the recent progress in these ar- eas. We highlight the potential for community ecologists to benefit from phylogenetic knowledge and suggest several avenues for future research.},

abstract = {Phylogenetic relationships among Pinus species from subgenus Strobus remain unresolved despite combined efforts based on nrITS and cpDNA. To provide greater resolution among these taxa, a 900-bp intron from a late embryogenesis abundant (LEA)-like gene (IFG8612)was sequenced from 39 pine species, with two or more alleles representing 33 species. Nineteen of 33 species exhibited allelic nonmonphyly in the strict consensus tree, and 10 deviated significantly from allelic monophyly based on topology incongruence tests. Intraspecific nucleotide diversity ranged from 0.0 to 0.0211, and analysis of variance shows that nucleotide diversity was strongly associated (P {\textless} 0.0001)with the degree of species monophyly. Although species nonmonophyly complicates phylogenetic interpretations, this nuclear locus offers greater topological support than previously observed for cpDNA or nrITS. Lacking evidence for hybridization, recombination, or imperfect taxonomy, we feel that incomplete lineage sorting remains the best explanation for the polymorphisms shared among species. Depending on the species, coalescent expectations indicate that reciprocal monophyly will be more likely than paraphyly in 1.71 to 24.0 x 10(6) years, and that complete genome-wide coalescence in these species may require up to 76.3 x 10(6) years. The absence of allelic coalescence is a severe constraint in the application of phylogenetic methods in Pinus, and taxa sharing similar life history traits with Pinus are likely to show species nonmonophyly using nuclear markers.},

abstract = {10.1073/pnas.0901637106 Estimating actual and potential areas of distribution of species via ecological niche modeling has become a very active field of research, yet important conceptual issues in this field remain confused. We argue that conceptual clarity is enhanced by adopting restricted definitions of “niche” that enable operational definitions of basic concepts like fundamental, potential, and realized niches and potential and actual distributional areas. We apply these definitions to the question of niche conservatism, addressing what it is that is conserved and showing with a quantitative example how niche change can be measured. In this example, we display the extremely irregular structure of niche space, arguing that it is an important factor in understanding niche evolution. Many cases of apparently successful models of distributions ignore biotic factors: we suggest explanations to account for this paradox. Finally, relating the probability of observing a species to ecological factors, we address the issue of what objects are actually calculated by different niche modeling algorithms and stress the fact that methods that use only presence data calculate very different quantities than methods that use absence data. We conclude that the results of niche modeling exercises can be interpreted much better if the ecological and mathematical assumptions of the modeling process are made explicit.},

abstract = {Chloroplast-expressed glutamine synthetase (ncpGS), a nuclear-encoded gene containing several introns, is introduced as a tool for phylogenetic studies at lower taxonomic levels. This gene is a member of a multigene family, but it diverged long ago from the cytosolic-expressed members of the family and appears to be single copy in the majority of taxa examined to date. The conservation of both coding sequence and position of introns has allowed the design of primers for use in a broad range of dicot taxa to amplify and sequence a region of ncpGS that contains four introns. The utility of this region in phylogenetic studies of congeneric species is illustrated by an example using eight Oxalis species. The four introns in these taxa are typical in size (76 to 136 bp), base composition (high T content), and structure (e.g., sequence of splice sites and putative branch points) for plant internal introns. Levels of variation among these ncpGS sequences compare favorably with those of the internal transcribed spacer of nuclear ribosomal DNA (ITS) from the same taxa, and results of phylogenetic analysis of ncpGS data are generally congruent with previous results using ITS.},

Two-years later some positive signs already emerge of the scientific, social and political achievements of the Brazilian LTER program. We discuss examples of how ecosystem and biodiversity information gathered within a long-term research approach are currently subsidizing decision-making as regards biodiversity conservation and watershed management at local and regional scales. Success in this respect has often been related to satisfactory communication between scientists, private companies, government and local citizens. Environmental education programs in the LTER sites are playing an important role in social and political integration. Most examples of integration of ecological research to decision-making in Brazil derive from case studies at local or regional scale. Despite the predominance of a bottom-up integrative pathway (from case studies to models; from local to national scale), some top-down initiatives are also in order, such as the construction of a model to estimate the inpact of different macroeconomic policies and growth trajectories on land use. We believe science and society in Brazil will benefit of the coexistence of bottom-up and top-down integrative approaches.},

The results suggest that Rosa in its traditional infrageneric circumscription is not reflected by molecular data.

Section Pimp- inellifoliae is split by the monotypic sections Laevigatae , Platyrhodon , Bracteatae and Hesperhodos . Section Caninae is a natural allopolyploid group characterized by its autapomorphic ITS C-type and Canina-meiosis. CpDNA sub- divides sect. Caninae into two natural clusters of eglandular and glandular species. NrITS shows sect. Synstylae / Indicae to be the direct sister group to sect.

abstract = {The genus Castanea (Fagaceae) is widely distributed in the deciduous forests of the Northern Hemisphere. The striking similarity between the floras of eastern Asia and those of eastern North America and the difference in chestnut blight resistance among species has been of interest to botanists for a century. To infer the biogeographical history of the genus, the phylogeny of Castanea was estimated using DNA sequence data from different regions of the chloroplast genome. Sequencing results support the genus Castanea as a monophyletic group with Castanea crenata as basal. The three Chinese species form a strongly supported sister clade to the North American and European clade. A unique westward expansion of extant Castanea species is hypothesized with Castanea originating in eastern Asia, an initial diversification within Asia during the Eocene followed by intercontinental dispersion and divergence between the Chinese and the European/North American species during the middle Eocene and a split between the European and the North American species in the late Eocene. The differentiation within North America and China might have occurred in early or late Miocene. The North America species are supported as a clade with C. pumila var. ozarkensis, the Ozark chinkapin, as the basal lineage, sister to the group comprising C. pumila var. pumila, the Allegheny chinkapin, and Castanea dentata, the American chestnut. Morphological evolution of one nut per bur in the genus may have occurred independently on two continents. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Traits that enable species to persist in ecological environments are often maintained over time, a phenomenon known as niche conservatism. Here we argue that ecological niches function at levels above species, notably at the level of genus for mammals, and that niche conservatism is also evident above the species level. Using the proxy of geographic range size, we explore changes in the realized niche of North American mammalian genera and families across the major climatic transition represented by the last glacial-interglacial transition. We calculate the mean and variance of range size for extant mammalian genera and families, rank them by range size, and estimate the change in range size and rank during the late Pleistocene and late Holocene. We demonstrate that range size at the genus and family levels was surprisingly constant over this period despite range shifts and extinctions of species within the clades. We suggest that underlying controls on niche conservatism may be different at these higher taxonomic levels than at the species level. Niche conservatism at higher levels seems primarily controlled by intrinsic life history traits, whereas niche conservatism at the species level may reflect underlying environmental controls. These results highlight the critical importance of conserving the biodiversity of mammals at the genus level and of maintaining an adequate species pool within genera.},

abstract = {Recent advances in ecological niche modeling (ENM) algorithms, in conjunction with increasing availability of geographic information system (GIS) data, allow species' niches to be predicted over broad geographic areas using environmental characteristics associated with point localities for a given species. Consequently, the examination of how niches evolve is now possible using a regionally inclusive multivariate approach to characterize the environmental requirements of a species. Initial work that uses this approach has suggested that niche evolution is characterized by conservatism: the more closely related species are, the more similar are their niches. We applied a phylogenetic approach to examine niche evolution during the radiation of Cuban trunk-ground anoles (Anolis sagrei group), which has produced 15 species in Cuba. We modeled the niche of 11 species within this group using the WhyWhere ENM algorithm and examined the evolution of the niche using a phylogeny based on approximately 1500 base pairs of mitochondrial DNA. No general relationship exists between phylogenetic similarity and niche similarity. Examination of species pairs indicates some examples in which closely related species display niche conservatism and some in which they exhibit highly divergent niches. In addition, some distantly related species exhibit significant niche similarity. Comparisons also revealed a specialist-generalist sister species pair in which the niche of one species is nested within, and much narrower than, the niche of another closely related species.},

abstract = {Recent models and analyses of paleoecological records suggest that tree populations are capable of rapid migration when climate warms. Fossil pollen is commonly interpreted as suggesting that the range of many temperate tree species expanded at rates of 100-1000 m/yr during the early Holocene. We used chloroplast DNA surveys to show that the geography of postglacial range expansion in two eastern North American tree species differs from that expected from pollen-based reconstructions and from patterns emerging from European molecular studies. Molecular evidence suggests that American beech (Fagus grandifolia) and red maple (Acer rubrum) persisted during the late glaciation as low-density populations, perhaps within 500 km of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Because populations were closer to modern range limits than previously thought, postglacial migration rates may have been slower than those inferred from fossil pollen. Our estimated rates of {\textless} 100 m/yr are consistent with model predictions based on life history and dispersal data, and suggest that past migration rates were substantially slower than the rates that will be needed to track 21st-century warming.},

There was a negative, albeit relatively weak, relationship between beta diversity and latitude. We found only relatively subtle differences in beta diversity among the realms, yet beta diversity was lower in marine systems than in terrestrial or freshwater realms. Beta diversity varied significantly among organisms' major characteristics such as body mass, trophic position, and dispersal type in the larger data set. Organisms that disperse via seeds had highest beta diversity, and passively dispersed organisms showed the lowest beta diversity. Furthermore, autotrophs had lower beta diversity than organisms higher up the food web; omnivores and carnivores had consistently higher beta diversity. This is evidence that beta diversity is simultaneously controlled by extrinsic factors related to geography and environment, and by intrinsic factors related to organism characteristics.},

abstract = {In the course of an adaptive radiation, the evolution of niche parameters is of particular interest for understanding modes of speciation and the consequences for coexistence of related species within communities. We pose a general question: In the course of an evolutionary radiation, do traits related to within-community niche differences (alpha niche) evolve before or after differentiation of macrohabitat affinity or climatic tolerances (beta niche)? Here we introduce a new test to address this question, based on a modification of the method of independent contrasts. The divergence order test (DOT) is based on the average age of the nodes on a tree, weighted by the absolute magnitude of the contrast at each node for a particular trait. The comparison of these weighted averages reveals whether large divergences for one trait have occurred earlier or later in the course of diversification, relative to a second trait; significance is determined by bootstrapping from maximum-likelihood ancestral state reconstructions. The method is applied to the evolution of Ceanothus, a woody plant group in California, in which co-occurring species exhibit significant differences in a key leaf trait (specific leaf area) associated with contrasting physiological and life history strategies. Co-occurring species differ more for this trait than expected under a null model of community assembly. This alpha niche difference evolved early in the divergence of two major subclades within Ceanothus, whereas climatic distributions (beta niche traits) diversified later within each of the subclades. However, rapid evolution of climate parameters makes inferences of early divergence events highly uncertain, and differentiation of the beta niche might have taken place throughout the evolution of the group, without leaving a clear phylogenetic signal. Similar patterns observed in several plant and animal groups suggest that early divergence of alpha niche traits might be a common feature of niche evolution in many adaptive radiations.},

abstract = {Chloroplast DNA sequences and microsatellites are useful tools for phylogenetic as well as population genetic analyses of plants. Chloroplast microsatellites tend to be less variable than nuclear microsatellites and therefore they may not be as powerful as nuclear microsatellites for within-species population analysis. However, chloroplast microsatellites may be useful for phylogenetic analysis between closely related taxa when more conventional loci, such as ITS or chloroplast sequence data, are not variable enough to resolve phylogenetic relationships in all clades. To determine the limits of chloroplast microsatellites as tools in phylogenetic analyses, we need to understand their evolution. Thus, we examined and compared phylogenetic relationships of species within the genus Clusia, using both chloroplast sequence data and variation at seven chloroplast microsatellite loci. Neither ITS nor chloroplast sequences were variable enough to resolve relationships within some sections of the genus, yet chloroplast microsatellite loci were too variable to provide any useful phylogenetic information. Size homoplasy was apparent, caused by base substitutions within the microsatellite, base substitutions in the flanking regions, indels in the flanking regions, multiple microsatellites within a fragment, and forward/reverse mutations of repeat length resulting in microsatellites of identical base composition that were not identical by descent.},

abstract = {Current diversity is the result of macroevolutionary processes of origination and extinction of lineages through time. Here we make use of a fossil-calibrated molecular-clock phylogeny of modern squirrel genera to estimate both rates of ‘birth' and ‘death', and the net rate of accumulation of lineages since the origin of the squirrel family (Sciuridae) 36 Ma. As a family, the Sciuridae have exhibited modest rates of diversification in comparison with other mammalian clades. Within the Sciuridae, lineages of squirrels have accumulated at higher rates in geographically localized subclades in the tropics of different continents. The rate is strik- ingly high in the Sciurini of South America, which first entered and radiated within that continent compara- tively recently (less than 3 Ma). It is noteworthy that the most rapidly diversifying groups are also rela- tively young. Because extinctions lag behind origina- tions, the effects of extinction are not yet detectable in relatively recent radiations. The balance of origination and extinction is fragile, and is likely to become more so if increases in extinction due to habitat destruction, climate change and other human activity are not miti- gated.},

abstract = {Microbial communities are typically large, diverse, and complex, and identifying and understanding the processes driving their structure has implications ranging from ecosystem stability to human health and well-being. Phylogenetic data gives us a new insight into these processes, providing a more informative perspective on functional and trait diversity than taxonomic richness alone. But the sheer scale of high resolution phylogenetic data also presents a new challenge to ecological theory. We bring a sampling theory perspective to microbial communities, considering a local community of co-occuring organisms as a sample from a larger regional pool, and apply our framework to make analytical predictions for local phylogenetic diversity arising from a given metacommunity and community assembly process. We characterize community assembly in terms of quantitative descriptions of clustered, random and overdispersed sampling, which have been associated with hypotheses of environmental filtering and competition. Using our approach, we analyze large microbial communities from the human microbiome, uncovering significant variation in diversity across habitats relative to the null hypothesis of random sampling.},

abstract = {Phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences have prompted spectacular progress in assembling the Tree of Life. However, progress in constructing phylogenies among closely related species, at least for plants, has been less encouraging. We show that for plants, the rapid accumulation of DNA characters at higher taxonomic levels has not been matched by conventional sequence loci at the species level, leaving a lack of well-resolved gene trees that is hindering investigations of many fundamental questions in plant evolutionary biology. The most popular approach to address this problem has been to use low-copy nuclear genes as a source of DNA sequence data. However, this has had limited success because levels of variation among nuclear intron sequences across groups of closely related species are extremely variable and generally lower than conventionally used loci, and because no universally useful low-copy nuclear DNA sequence loci have been developed. This suggests that solutions will, for the most part, be lineage-specific, prompting a move away from 'universal' gene thinking for species-level phylogenetics. The benefits and limitations of alternative approaches to locate more variable nuclear loci are discussed and the potential of anonymous nongenic nuclear loci is highlighted. Given the virtually unlimited number of loci that can be generated using these new approaches, it is clear that effective screening will be critical for efficient selection of the most informative loci. Strategies for screening are outlined.},

abstract = {Two phylogenetic comparative methods, independent contrasts and generalized least squares models, can be used to determine the statistical relationship between two or more traits. We show that the two approaches are functionally identical and that either can be used to make statistical inferences about values at internal nodes of a phylogenetic tree (hypothetical ancestors), to estimate relationships between characters, and to predict values for unmeasured species. Regression equations derived from independent contrasts can be placed back onto the original data space, including computation of both confidence intervals and prediction intervals for new observations. Predictions for unmeasured species (including extinct forms) can be made increasingly accurate and precise as the specificity of their placement on a phylogenetic tree increases, which can greatly increase statistical power to detect, for example, deviation of a single species from an allometric prediction. We reexamine published data for basal metabolic rates (BMR) of birds and show that conventional and phylogenetic allometric equations differ significantly. In new results, we show that, as compared with nonpasserines, passerines exhibit a lower rate of evolution in both body mass and mass-corrected BMR; passerines also have significantly smaller body masses than their sister clade. These differences may justify separate, clade-specific allometric equations for prediction of avian basal metabolic rates.},

We compiled data for 410 tree species from 18 forests ranging from 4 to 120 years after disturbance, and classified them by dispersal mode (animal vs. non-animal), successional group (pioneer vs. non-pioneer), vertical position (understorey vs. non-understorey) and geographic distribution (Atlantic Forest vs. widespread). We found that both geographical location and time since disturbance affect species distribution and ??-diversity. Regression analyses showed significant, positive and strong relations (0.26 ??? r2 ??? 0.63; P {\textless} 0.05) between fragment age and species richness, proportion of animal dispersed species, of non-pioneer species, of understorey species and with restricted distribution. Applying our data to values found in literature we predict that a forest needs about one to three hundred years to reach the proportion of animal-dispersed species (80{\%} of the species), the proportion of non-pioneer species (90{\%}) and of understorey species (50{\%}) found in mature forests. On the other hand much more time is necessary (between one and four thousand years) to reach the endemism levels (40{\%} of the species) that exist in mature forests. Our findings indicate that disturbance results in significant changes in species composition (decrease in endemic species) and ecological guilds (decrease in zoochory and in non-pioneer and understorey species), but forests can gradually recover over time spans of hundreds of years. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This pattern emerges because beta-diversity (compositional variation across local sites) increases with productivity, but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are unknown. Using data from a long-term experiment in replicate ponds, I show that higher beta-diversity at higher productivity resulted from a stronger role for stochastic relative to deterministic assembly processes with increasing productivity. This shift in the relative importance of stochasticity was most consistent with the hypothesis of more intense priority effects leading to multiple stable equilibria at higher productivity. Thus, shifts in community assembly mechanisms across a productivity gradient may underlie one of the most prominent biodiversity gradients on the planet.},

abstract = {A significant proportion of the global diversity of flowering plants has evolved in recent geological time, probably through adaptive radiation into new niches. However, rapid evolution is at odds with recent research which has suggested that plant ecological traits, including the beta- (or habitat) niche, evolve only slowly. We have quantified traits that determine within-habitat alpha diversity (alpha niches) in two communities in which species segregate on hydrological gradients. Molecular phylogenetic analysis of these data shows practically no evidence of a correlation between the ecological and evolutionary distances separating species, indicating that hydrological alpha niches are evolutionarily labile. We propose that contrasting patterns of evolutionary conservatism for alpha- and beta-niches is a general phenomenon necessitated by the hierarchical filtering of species during community assembly. This determines that species must have similar beta niches in order to occupy the same habitat, but different alpha niches in order to coexist.},

abstract = {An important dimension of adaptive radiation is the degree to which diversification rates fluctuate or remain constant through time. Focusing on plethodontid salamanders of the genus Desmognathus, we present a novel synthetic analysis of phylogeographic history, rates of ecomorphological evolution and species accumulation, and community assembly in an adaptive radiation. Dusky salamanders are highly variable in life history, body size, and ecology, with many endemic lineages in the southern Appalachian Highlands of eastern North America. Our results show that life-history evolution had important consequences for the buildup of plethodontid-salamander species richness and phenotypic disparity in eastern North America, a global hot spot of salamander biodiversity. The origin of Desmognathus species with aquatic larvae was followed by a high rate of lineage accumulation, which then gradually decreased toward the present time. The peak period of lineage accumulation in the group coincides with evolutionary partitioning of lineages with aquatic larvae into seepage, stream-edge, and stream microhabitats. Phylogenetic simulations demonstrate a strong correlation between morphology and microhabitat ecology independent of phylogenetic effects and suggest that ecomorphological changes are concentrated early in the radiation of Desmognathus. Deep phylogeographic fragmentation within many codistributed ecomorph clades suggests long-term persistence of ecomorphological features and stability of endemic lineages and communities through multiple climatic cycles. Phylogenetic analyses of community structure show that ecomorphological divergence promotes the coexistence of lineages and that repeated, independent evolution of microhabitat-associated ecomorphs has a limited role in the evolutionary assembly of Desmognathus communities. Comparing and contrasting our results to other adaptive radiations having different biogeographic histories, our results suggest that rates of diversification during adaptive radiation are intimately linked to the degree to which community structure persists over evolutionary time.},

abstract = {Model specification remains challenging in spectroscopy of plant biochemistry, as exemplified by the availability of various spectral indices or band combinations for estimating the same biochemical. This lack of consensus in model choice across applications argues for a paradigm shift in hyperspectral methods to address model uncertainty and misspecification. We demonstrated one such method using Bayesian model averaging (BMA), which performs variable/band selection and quantifies the relative merits of many candidate models to synthesize a weighted average model with improved predictive performances. The utility of BMA was examined using a portfolio of 27 foliage spectral-chemical datasets representing over 80 species across the globe to estimate multiple biochemical properties, including nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon, cellulose, lignin, chlorophyll (a or b), carotenoid, polar and nonpolar extractives, leaf mass per area, and equivalent water thickness. We also compared BMA with partial least squares (PLS) and stepwise multiple regression (SMR). Results showed that all the biochemicals except carotenoid were accurately estimated from hyerspectral data with R2 values{\textgreater}0.80. Compared to PLS and SMR, BMA substantially reduced overfitting and enhanced model generalization; BMA also yielded error estimation better indicative of true uncertainties in predictions, when evaluated using a statistic called "prediction interval coverage probability". The relative band importance, which was quantified by band selection probability, differed markedly between BMA and SMR, cautioning the use of SMR for band selection. Computationally, the model calibration with datasets of moderate sizes ({\textgreater}100) was faster for BMA via a hybrid reversible-jump Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampler than for PLS via literal optimization of a cross-validation criterion. Our BMA scheme also provides a generic hierarchical Bayesian framework to assimilate prior knowledge of diverse forms, as illustrated by its use to account for nonlinearity in spectral-chemical relationships. We emphasize that BMA is a competitive, paradigm-shifting alternative to conventional statistical methods and it will find wide use as the virtue of Bayesian inference is increasingly appreciated by the remote sensing community. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Substitution rate differs from most traits studied in that it cannot be observed directly, but must be inferred from substitutions accrued over a long period of time. Studying a mathematical model of trait and rate evolution, we show that the special nature of substitution rates can lead to a severe loss of power for standard comparative methods. We further show how strategies designed to maximise power, by increasing the number of data points, can have the opposite effect when substitution rate is involved. We then propose two modifications of the standard methods that can mitigate these problems. First, we show how pre-existing tests for homogeneity of variance can be used to identify and exclude those data from which changes in substitution rate cannot be reliably inferred. Second, we show that power can be increased by comparing substitution rate with the time average of the predictor trait along the history of the lineage, and introduce a maximum likelihood estimator of this quantity. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

It occurs both shaded, in forest habitats, or exposed to full sunlight, in the vegetation islands growing on sand deposits. Previous studies reported a high range of morpho-physiological variation for this species along a geographical gradient. This study compared leaf morphology and anatomy of A. legalis in two distinct but adjacent light environments: a dense forest (shaded) and a scrub of Palmae (exposed). We studied the amplitude of variation for these traits within a small (0.5 ha) geographical area. Leaf anatomy parameters were measured for five leaves collected from five plants in each habitat. The parameters measured were leaf and mesophyll thickness, thickness of the outer periclinal cell wall, thickness of the adaxial and abaxial epidermis and vascular bundle transversal section area, and also common epidermal cells, stomata and trichome density. Leaf morphology parameters were obtained from five leaves of each of 20 plants in each site. Dry and fresh weights were measured to obtain leaf specific mass and succulence. All anatomy and morphology parameters, except trichome density, were significantly higher for the sun-exposed plants. Less expected, however, was the marked qualitative difference between exposed and shaded plants: in the former the mesophyll had a unilateral symmetry (i.e., the whole mesophyll occupied by photosynthetic tissue), whereas in the latter there was a dorsiventral symmetry (i.e., partly palisade and partly spongy parenchyma). Such amplitude of variation shows that even within a small geographic area A. legalis has a broad ecological plasticity.},

abstract = {Accelerating rates of species extinction have prompted a growing number of researchers to manipulate the richness of various groups of organisms and examine how this aspect of diversity impacts ecological processes that control the functioning of ecosystems. We summarize the results of 44 experiments that have manipulated the richness of plants to examine how plant diversity affects the production of biomass. We show that mixtures of species produce an average of 1.7 times more biomass than species monocultures and are more productive than the average monoculture in 79{\%} of all experiments. However, in only 12{\%} of all experiments do diverse polycultures achieve greater biomass than their single most productive species. Previously, a positive net effect of diversity that is no greater than the most productive species has been interpreted as evidence for selection effects, which occur when diversity maximizes the chance that highly productive species will be included in and ultimately dominate the biomass of polycultures. Contrary to this, we show that although productive species do indeed contribute to diversity effects, these contributions are equaled or exceeded by species complementarity, where biomass is augmented by biological processes that involve multiple species. Importantly, both the net effect of diversity and the probability of polycultures being more productive than their most productive species increases through time, because the magnitude of complementarity increases as experiments are run longer. Our results suggest that experiments to date have, if anything, underestimated the impacts of species extinction on the productivity of ecosystems.},

@article{Maun1998,
abstract = {One of the most obvious features on the foredunes and strands of coasts and lakes is recurrent burial in sand. Burial levels vary in different coastal sand dune systems and influence the physical and biotic microenvironment of the plant and soil. Foredune plants along coasts possess numerous adaptations to withstand burial. Studies show that below a certain threshold level of burial, the growth of all foredune plant species is stimulated probably because of multiple factors, namely improved soil resources, increase in soil volume, reactive plant growth, and enhanced mycorrhizal activity. However, as the level of burial increases, the positive response starts to decline until it becomes a negative value. For example, burial may reduce seed germination, seedling emergence, survival, and growth of seedlings and adult plants. At the community level, burial acts as a filter and selectively eliminates susceptible species, reduces the relative abundance of less tolerant species, and increases the abundance of tolerant and sand-dependent species. However, if sand deposition continues unabated, even the sand-dependent species are eliminated and a bare area is created. The emergence of a plant from a burial deposit primarily depends on the energy reserves in its storage organs and the speed, depth, and frequency of burial. Upon burial the plants shift resources from the belowground to the aboveground parts. Different plants show varied morphological responses to sand accretion. For example, the culms of grasses emerge by an increase in the number of nodes per culm and the elongation of internodes. Similarly, the emergent trunks and woody branches of tolerant trees and shrubs produce new buds and suckers at a higher level on the stem. In response to burial, the coastal sand dune species produce shootborne roots close Co the new soil surface probably because of decreased oxygen levels.},

@article{Clark2003a,
abstract = {Two hypotheses to explain potentially high forest biodiversity have different implications for the number and kinds of species that can coexist and the potential loss of biodiversity in the absence of speciation. The first hypothesis involves stabilizing mechanisms, which include tradeoffs between species in terms of their capacities to disperse to sites where competition is weak, to exploit abundant resources effectively and to compete for scarce resources. Stabilization results because competitors thrive at different times and places. An alternative, 'neutral model' suggests that stabilizing mechanisms may be superfluous. This explanation emphasizes 'equalizing' mechanisms, because competitive exclusion of similar species is slow. Lack of ecologically relevant differences means that abundances experience random 'neutral drift', with slow extinction. The relative importance of these two mechanisms is unknown, because assumptions and predictions involve broad temporal and spatial scales. Here we demonstrate that predictions of neutral drift are testable using palaeodata. The results demonstrate strong stabilizing forces. By contrast with the neutral prediction of increasing variance among sites over time, we show that variances in post-Glacial tree abundances among sites stabilize rapidly, and abundances remain coherent over broad geographical scales.},

After reviewing these two approaches, it then explains how models based on the Maximum Entropy Formalism can be used to predict the relative abundance of different species from a potential species pool. Following this it shows how the trait constraints, upon which the model is based, are necessary consequences of natural selection and population dynamics. The final sections of the book extend the discussion to macroecological patterns of species abundance and concludes with some outstanding unresolved questions. Written for advanced undergraduates, graduates and researchers in plant ecology, Bill Shipley demonstrates how a trait-based approach, can explain how the principle of natural selection and quantitative genetics can be combined with maximum entropy methods to explain and predict the structure of plant communities.},

abstract = {What determines which plant species are susceptible to a given plant pathogen is poorly understood. Experimental inoculations with fungal pathogens of plant leaves in a tropical rain forest show that most fungal pathogens are polyphagous but that most plant species in a local community are resistant to any given pathogen. The likelihood that a pathogen can infect two plant species decreases continuously with phylogenetic distance between the plants, even to ancient evolutionary distances. This phylogenetic signal in host range allows us to predict the likely host range of plant pathogens in a local community, providing an important tool for plant ecology, design of agronomic systems, quarantine regulations in international trade, and risk analysis of biological control agents. In particular, the results suggest that the rate of spread and ecological impacts of a disease through a natural plant community will depend strongly on the phylogenetic structure of the community itself and that current regulatory approaches strongly underestimate the local risks of global movement of plant pathogens or their hosts.},

Here, we undertook intensive field collections in two biodiversity hotspots (Mesoamerica and southern Africa). Using {\textgreater}1,600 samples, we compared eight potential barcodes. Going beyond previous plant studies, we assessed to what extent a "DNA barcoding gap" is present between intra- and interspecific variations, using multiple accessions per species. Given its adequate rate of variation, easy amplification, and alignment, we identified a portion of the plastid matK gene as a universal DNA barcode for flowering plants. Critically, we further demonstrate the applicability of DNA barcoding for biodiversity inventories. In addition, analyzing {\textgreater}1,000 species of Mesoamerican orchids, DNA barcoding with matK alone reveals cryptic species and proves useful in identifying species listed in Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) appendixes.},

On a continental-wide scale, we assessed alpha-diversity patterns of black-water flooded forests across the Amazon and Orinoco basins. Phytosociological analyses include family and species importance, species similarity, and Fisher's alpha-diversity, as well as Detrended Correspondence Analysis. A total of 6.126 individuals were recorded, belonging to 243 tree species. Only few tree species occurred in more than one river section, and floristic composition changed abruptly from one section to the other. Tree species richness ranged from 57 to 79 species ha−1, and alpha-diversity was highest (27.24) in the lower river section upon sediments of Pliocene–Pleistocene origin. We found a gradual decrease in species diversity with increasing age of the geological formations. The igap{\'{o}} forest is relatively species-poor, which we interpret to be the result of general low nutrient availability in alluvial substrates of the Negro River.},

abstract = {Abstract Aim The flowering plant family Proteaceae is putatively of Gondwanan age, with modern and fossil lineages found on all southern continents. Here we test whether the present distribution of Proteaceae can be explained by vicariance caused by the break-up of Gondwana. Location Africa, especially southern Africa, Australia, New Zealand, South America, New Caledonia, New Guinea, Southeast Asia, Sulawesi, Tasmania. Methods We obtained chloroplast DNA sequence data from the rbcL gene, the rbcL-atpB spacer, and the atpB gene from leaf samples of forty-five genera collected from the field and from living collections. We analysed these data using Bayesian phylogenetic and molecular dating methods, with five carefully selected fossil calibration points to obtain age estimates for the nodes within the family. Results Four of eight trans-continental disjunctions of sister groups within our sample of the Proteaceae post-date the break-up of Gondwana. These involve independent lineages, two with an Africa-Australia disjunction, one with an Africa-South America disjunction, and one with a New Zealand-Australasia disjunction. The date of the radiation of the bird-pollinated Embothriinae corresponds approximately to the hypothesized date of origin of nectar-feeding birds in Australia. Main conclusions The findings suggest that disjunct distributions in Proteaceae result from both Gondwanan vicariance and transoceanic dispersal. Our results imply that ancestors of some taxa dispersed across oceans rather than rafting with Gondwanan fragments as previously thought. This finding agrees with other studies of Gondwanan plants in dating the divergence of Australian, New Zealand and New Caledonian taxa in the Eocene, consistent with the existence of a shared, ancestral Eocene flora but contrary to a vicariance scenario based on accepted geological knowledge.},

abstract = {• Premise of the study: Parthenocissus is a genus of the grape family Vitaceae and has a disjunct distribution in Asia and North America with members in both tropical and temperate regions. The monophyly of Parthenocissus has not yet been tested, and the species relationships and the evolution of its intercontinental disjunction have not been investigated with extensive sampling and molecular phylogenetic methods. • Methods: Plastid (trnL-F, rps16, and atpB-rbcL) and nuclear GAI1 sequences of 56 accessions representing all 12 Parthenocissus species were analyzed with parsimony, likelihood, and Bayesian inference. Divergence times of disjunct lineages were estimated with relaxed Bayesian dating. Evolution of the leaflet number was assessed by tracing this character onto Bayesian trees using the Trace Character Over Trees option in the program Mesquite. • Key results: Parthenocissus is monophyletic and sister to the newly described segregate genus Yua. Two major clades within Parthenocissus are recognizable corresponding to their distribution in Asia and North America. The disjunction between the two continents is estimated to be at 21.64 (95{\%} higher posterior densities 10.23-34.89) million years ago. • Conclusions: Parthenocissus is likely to have derived from the Eocene boreotropical element. Its current Asian-North American disjunction is dated to the early Miocene, congruent with fossil and paleoclimatic evidence. The tropical species is nested within the temperate clade and is inferred to have dispersed from the adjacent temperate regions. Parthenocissus and Yua are best treated as distinct genera. Leaflet number in this genus has a complex history and cannot be used as a character for infrageneric classification.},

We suggest that 'bottleneck' might be a more appropriate term to use for temporarily reduced populations, to indicate continuity of the populations, and that individualistic response of taxa to climate change appears to extend to intra-specific levels.

A low level of genetic differentiation was observed among H. tiliaceus populations in the Pacific and Indian Ocean regions, similar to the results of a previous chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) study. Frequent gene flow by long-distance seed dispersal is responsible for species integration of H. tiliaceus in the wide distribution range. On the other hand, highly differentiated populations of H. tiliaceus were detected in West Africa, as well as of Hibiscus pernambucensis in southern Brazil. In the former populations, the African continent may be a geographical barrier that prevents gene flow by sea-drifted seeds. In the latter populations, although there are no known land barriers, the bifurcating South Equatorial Current at the north-eastern horn of Brazil can be a potential barrier to gene flow and may promote the genetic differentiation of these populations. Our results also suggest clear species segregation between H. tiliaceus and H. pernambucensis, which confirms the introgression scenario between these two species that was suggested by a previous cpDNA study. Our results also provide good evidence for recent transatlantic long-distance seed dispersal by sea current. Despite the distinct geographical structure observed in the cpDNA haplotypes, a low level of genetic differentiation was found between Pacific and Atlantic populations of H. pernambucensis, which could be caused by transisthmian gene flow.},

abstract = {Geographical distributions of terrestrial or freshwater taxa that are broken up by oceans can be explained by either oceanic dispersal or vicariance in the form of fragmentation of a previously contiguous landmass. The validation of plate-tectonics theory provided a global vicariance mechanism and, along with cladistic arguments for the primacy of vicariance, helped create a view of oceanic dispersal as a rare phenomenon and an explanation of last resort. Here, I describe recent work that suggests that the importance of oceanic dispersal has been strongly underestimated. In particular, molecular dating of lineage divergences favors oceanic dispersal over tectonic vicariance as an explanation for disjunct distributions in a wide variety of taxa, from frogs to beetles to baobab trees. Other evidence, such as substantial gene flow among island populations of Anolis lizards, also indicates unexpectedly high frequencies of oceanic dispersal. The resurrection of oceanic dispersal is the most striking aspect of a major shift in historical biogeography toward a more even balance between vicariance and dispersal explanations. This new view implies that biotas are more dynamic and have more recent origins than had been thought previously. A high frequency of dispersal also suggests that a fundamental methodological assumption of many biogeographical studies - that vicariance is a priori a more probable explanation than dispersal - needs to be re-evaluated and perhaps discarded.},

abstract = {Global change challenges forest adaptability at the distributional limit of species. We studied ring-porous Quercus canariensis Willd. xylem traits to analyze how they adjust to spatio-temporal variability in climate. Trees were sampled along altitudinal transects, and annual time series of radial growth (ring width (RW)) and several earlywood vessel (EV) traits were built to analyze their relationships with climate. The trees responded to increasing water constraints with decreasing altitude and changes in climate in the short term but the analyses showed that xylem did not acclimate in response to long-term temperature increase during the past 30 years. The plants' adjustment to climate variability was expressed in a different but complementary manner by the different xylem traits. At low elevations, trees exhibited higher correlations with water stress indices and trees acclimated to more xeric conditions at low elevations by reducing radial growth and hydraulic diameter (D-H) but increasing the density of vessels (DV). Average potential conductivity (K-H) was similar for trees at different altitudes. However, inter-tree differences in xylem traits were higher than those between altitudes, suggesting a strong influence of individual genetic features or micro-site conditions. Trees exhibited higher RW those years with larger D-H and particularly the linear density of vessels (DVl), but partly, climatic signals expressed in RW differed from those in EVs. Trees produced larger D-H after cold winters and wet years. Ring width responded positively to wet and cool weather in fall and spring, whereas the response to climate of DV and K-H was generally opposite to that of RW. These relationships likely expressed the negative impact of high respiration rates in winter on the carbon pools used to produce the EVs in the next spring and the overall positive influence of water availability for trees. Our results showed that trees at different sites were able to adjust their hydraulic architecture to climatic variability and temperature increase during recent decades coordinating several complementary traits. Nonetheless, it should be monitored whether they will succeed to acclimate to future climatic scenarios of increasing water stress.},

abstract = {Species richness, Shannon information, and Simpson diversity are the three most commonly used nonparametric measures of species diversity. The sampling bias and variance of these measures differ greatly. Species richness may be seriously underestimated for even very large samples from a speciose community. The bias in species richness and Shannon information depend on unknown parameters of the species abundance distribution. An unbiased estimator exists only for Simpson diversity. Each of these measures is concave, so that the total diversity in a pooled set of communities exceeds (or equals) the average diversity within communities. The total diversity in a set of communities can therefore be partitioned into positive, additive components within and among communities, corresponding to $\alpha$- and $\beta$-diversity. Partitioning Simpson diversity corresponds to an analysis of variance. The proportion of the total diversity found within communities provides a natural measure of similarity among multiple communities. The expected similarity among multiple random samples from the same community depends on the number of samples and on the underlying measure of diversity.},

abstract = {Understanding tropical forest tree diversity has been a major challenge to ecologists. In the absence of compensatory mechanisms, two powerful forces, drift and competition, are expected to erode diversity quickly, especially in communities containing scores or hundreds of rare species. Here, I review evidence bearing on four compensatory mechanisms that have been subsumed under the terms "density dependence" or "negative density dependence": (1) intra- and (2) interspecific competition and the action of (3) density-responsive and (4) distance-responsive biotic agents, as postulated by Janzen and Connell. To achieve ontological integration, I examine evidence based on studies employing seeds, seedlings, and saplings. Available evidence points overwhelmingly to the action of both host-generalist and host-restricted biotic agents as causing most seed and seedling mortality, implying that species diversity is maintained via top-down forcing. The overall effect of most host-generalist seed predators and herbivores is to even out the distribution of surviving propagules. Spatially restricted recruitment appears to result mainly, if not exclusively, from the actions of host-restricted agents, principally microarthropods and fungi, that attack hosts in a distance-dependent fashion as Janzen and Connell proposed. Near total failure of propagules close to reproductive conspecifics ensures that successful reproduction occurs through a scant rain of dispersed seeds. Densities of dispersed seeds and seedlings arising from them are so low as to generally preclude the operation of density dependence, at least during early ontogenetic stages. I conclude that Janzen and Connell were essentially correct and that diversity maintenance results from top-down forcing acting in a spatially nonuniform fashion.},

abstract = {Many empirical studies have assessed fine-scale spatial genetic structure (SGS), i.e. the nonrandom spatial distribution of genotypes, within plant populations using genetic markers and spatial autocorrelation techniques. These studies mostly provided qualitative descriptions of SGS, rendering quantitative comparisons among studies difficult. The theory of isolation by distance can predict the pattern of SGS under limited gene dispersal, suggesting new approaches, based on the relationship between pairwise relatedness coefficients and the spatial distance between individuals, to quantify SGS and infer gene dispersal parameters. Here we review the theory underlying such methods and discuss issues about their application to plant populations, such as the choice of the relatedness statistics, the sampling scheme to adopt, the procedure to test SGS, and the interpretation of spatial autocorrelograms. We propose to quantify SGS by an 'Sp' statistic primarily dependent upon the rate of decrease of pairwise kinship coefficients between individuals with the logarithm of the distance in two dimensions. Under certain conditions, this statistic estimates the reciprocal of the neighbourhood size. Reanalysing data from, mostly, published studies, the Sp statistic was assessed for 47 plant species. It was found to be significantly related to the mating system (higher in selfing species) and to the life form (higher in herbs than trees), as well as to the population density (higher under low density). We discuss the necessity for comparing SGS with direct estimates of gene dispersal distances, and show how the approach presented can be extended to assess (i) the level of biparental inbreeding, and (ii) the kurtosis of the gene dispersal distribution.},

abstract = {Many studies have examined invasion resistance in plant communities, but few have explored the mechanisms of invasion and how subsequent community reassembly affects community functioning. Using natural dispersal and deliberate seed addition into grassland communities with different compositional and richness histories, we show that invaders establish in a nonrandom manner due to negative effects of resident functional groups on invading species from the same functional group. Invaders hence complement communities with originally low richness levels. Consequently, communities converge toward similar levels of species richness, high functional richness, and evenness, but not always maximum productivity. Invasion processes are faster but qualitatively similar when the effect of chance, in the form of dispersal stochasticity, is reduced by seed addition. Thus, dispersal limitation may influence community assembly, but it does not override functionally predictable assembly mechanisms. Some of the most productive communities prior to invasion are unstable in the face of invasion, leading to decreased productivity following invasion. We suggest that invasion into such communities occurs possibly because a pathogen-free niche is available rather than a resource niche. Thus, pathogens in addition to resource niches may be important biological drivers of community assembly.},

abstract = {Aim To examine how the genetic diversity of selected taxa of forest-dwelling small mammals is distributed between and within the major rain forest domains of Amazonia and Atlantic Forest and the intervening interior forests of Brazil, as inferred by the relationships between gene genealogies and geography. I also addressed the historical importance of the central Brazilian forests in connecting Amazon and Atlantic Forest populations of rodents and marsupials. Methods I evaluated variation in the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene to estimate the levels of sequence divergence between those taxa occurring throughout the Amazon, Atlantic Forest, and forests in the Cerrado and Caatinga regions. I inferred the hierarchical relationships between haplotypes, populations and formal taxa using the cladistic approach of maximum parsimony. I compared areas and the clades identified by superimposing cladograms on the geographical distribution of samples. The degree of concordance both in phylogeny and the depth of the nodes in these phylogenies, in addition to patterns of geographical distribution of clades, permitted me to make inferences on how, when and where the taxa differentiated. Results Sequence similarity is often greater between samples from the Atlantic Forest and either Amazon or central Brazilian forests than it is within each of the two rain forest domains. The Atlantic Forest clades are either not reciprocally monophyletic or are the sister group to all the other clades. There is some indication of northern and southern components in the Atlantic Forest. Given the geographical distribution of clades and the relatively deep levels of divergence, the central Brazilian area does not behave as a separate region but is complementary to either Amazon or Atlantic Forest. Patterns of area relationships differ across taxa, suggesting that different processes and/or historic events affected the diversification within each lineage. Main conclusions The Amazon and the Atlantic forests are not exclusive in terms of their small mammal faunas; both overlap broadly with taxa occurring in gallery forests and dry forests in central Brazil. Central Brazilian forests are an integral part of the evolutionary scenario of lowland small mammals, playing an important role as present and past habitats for rain forest species. Therefore, representatives from this area should always be included in analyses of the evolutionary history of lowland rain forest faunas. The incongruence of branching patterns among areas is in agreement with recent results presented for Neotropical passerine birds and indicates that a single hypothesis of Neotropical area relationships is unlikely. These findings reinforce the idea that speciation in the Neotropics will not be explained by any single model of vicariance or climatic changes.},

abstract = {Extinction risk in natural populations depends on stochastic factors that affect individuals, and is estimated by incorporating such factors into stochastic models. Stochasticity can be divided into four categories, which include the probabilistic nature of birth and death at the level of individuals (demographic stochasticity), variation in population-level birth and death rates among times or locations (environmental stochasticity), the sex of individuals and variation in vital rates among individuals within a population (demographic heterogeneity). Mechanistic stochastic models that include all of these factors have not previously been developed to examine their combined effects on extinction risk. Here we derive a family of stochastic Ricker models using different combinations of all these stochastic factors, and show that extinction risk depends strongly on the combination of factors that contribute to stochasticity. Furthermore, we show that only with the full stochastic model can the relative importance of environmental and demographic variability, and therefore extinction risk, be correctly determined. Using the full model, we find that demographic sources of stochasticity are the prominent cause of variability in a laboratory population of Tribolium castaneum (red flour beetle), whereas using only the standard simpler models would lead to the erroneous conclusion that environmental variability dominates. Our results demonstrate that current estimates of extinction risk for natural populations could be greatly underestimated because variability has been mistakenly attributed to the environment rather than the demographic factors described here that entail much higher extinction risk for the same variability level.},

The temperate deciduous forests showed a strong concentration of canopy species and a dearth of subcanopy species. In contrast, the four tropical forests showed more uniform distributions of maximum heights, while the subtropical forest had an intermediate distribution. The tropical and subtropical sites had greater densities of small trees than did the temperate sites and most of these small trees were members of small-to medium-sized species. Sapling recruitment per unit stem basal area increased with declining maximum height in Panama, which is consistent with the criterion for coexistence of species of differing stature derived from Kohyama's forest architecture hypothesis. Greater penetration of light into gaps and favourable conditions for growth over most of the year may allow more smaller-statured species to coexist with canopy trees in tropical vs. temperate forests.},

abstract = {To survive changes in climate, successful species shift their geographic ranges to remain in suitable habitats. For parasites and other highly specialized species, distributional changes not only are dictated by climate but can also be engineered by their hosts. The extent of host control on parasite range expansion is revealed through comparisons of host and parasite migration and demographic histories. However, understanding the codistributional history of entire forest communities is complicated by challenges in synthesizing datasets from multiple interacting species of differing datatypes. Here we integrate genetic and fossil pollen datasets from a host-parasite pair; specifically, the population structure of the parasitic plant (Epifagus virginiana) was compared with both its host (Fagus grandifolia) genetic patterns and abundance data from the paleopollen record of the last 21,000 y. Through tests of phylogeographic structure and spatial linear regression models we find, surprisingly, host range changes had little effect on the parasite's range expansion and instead host density is the main driver of parasite spread. Unlike other symbionts that have been used as proxies to track their host's movements, this parasite's migration routes are incongruent with the host and instead reflect the greater importance of host density in this community's assembly. Furthermore, these results confirm predictions of disease ecological models regarding the role of host density in the spread of pathogens. Due to host density constraints, highly specialized species may have low migration capacities and long lag times before colonization of new areas.},

abstract = {Both facilitative and competitive interactions occur simultaneously among plants, and the net balance between them can vary over time. Despite this, recent model-fitting studies have found that negative interactions predominate. This suggests that more complex models may be necessary to uncover facilitation. Here we fitted models including seasonality, interannual variation, and time lags to survey data to test for patterns in positive and negative interactions among plants in a Michigan dry sand prairie. We hypothesized that interactions would be generally facilitative in this dry environment. Results indicate that most immediate (direct) interactions among dominant species are actually competitive, although interactions were more facilitative over the drier summer season. Interestingly, lagged density dependence was strong for all species in both seasons; it was positive for conspecific interactions and both positive and negative for heterospecific interactions. Observed lagged density dependence is likely due to effects from litter and/or past storage in rhizomes. Conspecific immediate and lagged interactions tended to be stronger than heterospecific interactions, suggesting that population dynamics in this community are driven mostly by conspecifics. Overall, the presence of strong lagged density dependence in this system suggests that it may be more widespread in plants than previously thought.},

abstract = {For many biological investigations, groups of individuals are genetically sampled from several geographic locations. These sampling locations often do not reflect the genetic population structure. We describe a framework using marginal likelihoods to compare and order structured population models, such as testing whether the sampling locations belong to the same randomly mating population or comparing unidirectional and multidirectional gene flow models. In the context of inferences employing Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, the accuracy of the marginal likelihoods depends heavily on the approximation method used to calculate the marginal likelihood. Two methods, modified thermodynamic integration and a stabilized harmonic mean estimator, are compared. With finite Markov chain Monte Carlo run lengths, the harmonic mean estimator may not be consistent. Thermodynamic integration, in contrast, delivers considerably better estimates of the marginal likelihood. The choice of prior distributions does not influence the order and choice of the better models when the marginal likelihood is estimated using thermodynamic integration, whereas with the harmonic mean estimator the influence of the prior is pronounced and the order of the models changes. The approximation of marginal likelihood using thermodynamic integration in MIGRATE allows the evaluation of complex population genetic models, not only of whether sampling locations belong to a single panmictic population, but also of competing complex structured population models.},

abstract = {This paper provides a synthesis of the three papers published in the series "Ecophysiology of selected tree species in different plant communities at the periphery of the Atlantic forest of SE - Brazil" (Trees, this issue). We reviewed data obtained for seven tree species, belonging to the legume family and the genus Clusia of the Clusiaceae. These groups were chosen because legumes are the most abundant tree species in the Atlantic forest complex (except in the open restingas), and the genus Clusia is reportedly of utmost ecological importance as nurse plants in several habitats of the complex. These species were surveyed along one or more of several forest and open habitats at the margin of the Atlantic rain forest (open restingas, restinga dry forest, inselberg, semideciduous dry forest) and indicated the following general patterns: (1) at the intraspecific level, ecophysiological performance often (but not always) varied largely in both time and space; (2) at the interspecific level, ecophysiological performance was often (but not always) related positively to species dominance in the community; and (3) at both levels, ecophysiological performance was not related to the geographic distribution patterns, i.e., generalists and specialists did not form groups of similarly behaving plants in regard to ecophysiology. We discuss the implications of these findings, compare them with earlier studies, and suggest that ecophysiological research in the Atlantic rain forest complex could enhance its explanatory power by increasing spatial and temporal scales of observation},

abstract = {We describe a model-based clustering method for using multilocus genotype data to infer population structure and assign individuals to populations. We assume a model in which there are K populations (where K may be unknown), each of which is characterized by a set of allele frequencies at each locus. Individuals in the sample are assigned (probabilistically) to populations, or jointly to two or more populations if their genotypes indicate that they are admixed. Our model does not assume a particular mutation process, and it can be applied to most of the commonly used genetic markers, provided that they are not closely linked. Applications of our method include demonstrating the presence of population structure, assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones, and identifying migrants and admixed individuals. We show that the method can produce highly accurate assignments using modest numbers of loci-e.g. , seven microsatellite loci in an example using genotype data from an endangered bird species.

All species were either clumped or randomly dispersed, with rare species more clumped than common species. Breeding system was unrelated to species abundance or dispersion, but clumping was related to mode of seed dispersal. Juvenile densities decreased approximately exponentially away from adults. Rare species gave evidence of poor reproductive performance compared with their performance when common in nearby forests. Patterns of relative species abundance in the dry forest are compared with patterns in other forests, and are explained by a simple stochastic model based on random-walk immigration and extinction set in motion by periodic community disturbance.},

We show that plastid DNA is recoverableand usable from pollen grains of Scots pine Pinus sylvestris from 10 ka and 100 years ago. Comparison of the ancient sequences with modern sequences,obtained from an extant population, establish a first genetic link betweenmodern and fossil samples of Scots pine, providing a genetic continuity through time. One common haplotype is present in each of the three periods investigated, suggesting that it persisted near the lake throughout the postglacial. The retrieval of aDNA from pollen has major implications for palaeoecology by allowing (i) investigation of populationlevel dynamics in time and space, and (ii) tracing ancestry of populations and developing phylogenetic trees that include extinct as well as extant taxa. The method should work over the last glacial oscillation, thus giving access to ancestry of populations over a crucial period of time for the understanding of the relationship between speciation and climate change.},

abstract = {Holocene data from the Caribbean and the Atlantic coast of South America have been critically assessed and a subset of the best quality data are presented. These data cover a large north-south geographic extent and display a distinct spatial variation. We make the first comparisons of this data set to predictions based on a realistic model of glaciation-induced sea-level change with the main aims of understanding the cause of the observed spatial trend and estimating a eustatic signal for the Holocene. The spatial variation is dominated by the influence of the ice and ocean mass redistribution on sea-level change, with the ice-induced effect dominating the observed north-south trend. A best-fitting model is applied to estimate a Holocene eustatic signal from the observations. We find that the model-corrected data are consistent with a relatively rapid rise of 7-8 mm/yr in the early Holocene with a marked reduction in this rate around 7 cal. kyr BP. From this time until present, the model-corrected data suggest that the volume of mass transfer between ice sheets and oceans was no more than ?????1m (eustatic sea-level equivalent). ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The question is often raised whether it is statistically necessary to control for phylogenetic associations in comparative studies. To investigate this question, we explore the use of a measure of phylogenetic correlation, X, introduced by Pagel (1999), that nor- mally varies between 0 (phylogenetic independence) and 1 (species' traits covary in direct proportion to their shared evolutionary his- tory). Simulations show X to be a statistically powerful index for measuring whether data exhibit phylogenetic dependence or not and whether it has low rates of Type I error. Moreover, X is robust to incomplete phylogenetic information, which demonstrates that even partial information on phylogeny will improve the accuracy of phy- logenetic analyses. To assess whether traits generally show phyloge- netic associations, we present a quantitative review of 26 published phylogenetic comparative data sets. The data sets include 103 traits and were chosen from the ecological literature in which debate about the need for phylogenetic correction has been most acute. Eighty- eight percent of data sets contained at least one character that dis- played significant phylogenetic dependence, and 60{\%} of characters overall (pooled across studies) showed significant evidence of phy- logenetic association. In 16{\%} of tests, phylogenetic correlation could be neither supported nor rejected. However, most of these equivocal results were found in small phylogenies and probably reflect a lack of power. We suggest that the parameter X be routinely estimated when analyzing comparative data, since it can also be used simul- taneously to adjust the phylogenetic correction in a manner that is optimal for the data set, and we present an example of how this may be done.},

abstract = {Fossil plants provide data on climate, community composition and structure, all of which are relevant to the definition and recognition of biomes. Macrofossils reflect local vegetation, whereas pollen assemblages sample a larger area. The earliest solid evidence for angiosperm tropical rainforest in Africa is based primarily on Late Eocene to Late Oligocene (ca. 39-26 Myr ago) pollen assemblages from Cameroon, which are rich in forest families. Plant macrofossil assemblages from elsewhere in interior Africa for this time interval are rare, but new work at Chilga in the northwestern Ethiopian Highlands documents forest communities at 28 Myr ago. Initial results indicate botanical affinities with lowland West African forest. The earliest known woodland community in tropical Africa is dated at 46 Myr ago in northern Tanzania, as documented by leaves and fruits from lake deposits. The community around the lake was dominated by caesalpinioid legumes, but included Acacia, for which this, to my knowledge, is the earliest record. This community is structurally similar to modern miombo, although it is different at the generic level. The grass-dominated savannah biome began to expand in the Middle Miocene (16 Myr ago), and became widespread in the Late Miocene (ca. 8 Myr ago), as documented by pollen and carbon isotopes from both West and East Africa.},

A combined analysis of the data (identical to the ITS results) provided a more resolved phylogeny of the Laureae, with four major lineages: the Laurus, Litsea, Lindera and Actinodaphne II clades. These clades also appear to reflect the importance of inflorescence structure and ontogeny within the Laureae, as well as data from cuticular micromorphology, but there was no support for traditional generic characters such as 2- versus 4- celled anthers.

Then we discuss reciprocal transplant and common garden experiments designed to detect local adaptation in the pattern of deme x habitat interaction for fitness. Finally, we review research questions and approaches to studying the processes of local adaptation - divergent natural selection, dispersal and gene flow, and other processes affecting adaptive differentiation of local demes. We advocate multifaceted approaches to the study of local adaptation, and stress the need for experiments explicitly addressing hypotheses about the role of particular ecological and genetic factors that promote or hinder local adaptation.

Here, we present phylogenetic generalized linear mixed models (PGLMMs) that can statistically test a wide variety of phylogenetic patterns in community structure. In contrast to most current statistical approaches that rely on community metrics and randomization tests, PGLMMs are model-based statistics that fit observed presence/absence data to underlying hypotheses about the distributions of species among communities. We built four PGLMMs to address (1) phylogenetic patterns in community composition, (2) phylogenetic variation in species sensitivities to environmental gradients among communities, (3) phylogenetic repulsion in which closely related species are less likely to co-occur, and (4) trait-based variation in species sensitivities to environmental gradients.

Exceptional spectral power in climate is recorded at the 406-thousand-year (ky) period eccentricity band over a 3.4-million-year period [20 to 23.4 My ago (Ma)] as well as in the 125- and 95-ky bands over a 1.3-million-year period (21.7 to 23.0 Ma) of suspected low greenhouse gas levels. Moreover, a major transient glaciation at the epoch boundary ( approximately 23 Ma), Mi-1, corresponds with a rare orbital congruence involving obliquity and eccentricity. The anomaly, which consists of low-amplitude variance in obliquity (a node) and a minimum in eccentricity, results in an extended period ( approximately 200 ky) of low seasonality orbits favorable to ice-sheet expansion on Antarctica.},

abstract = {1. Phylogenetic signal - the similarity in trait values among phylogenetically related species - is pervasive for most types of traits in most organisms. Traits can often be categorized a priori into groups based on the level of biological organization, functional relations, developmental origins, or genetic underpinnings. Traits within such groups are often expected to be correlated and hence show similar levels of phylogenetic signal. 2. We developed multivariate statistical methods to test for phylogenetic signal in groups of traits while also incorporating estimates of trait measurement error (including within-species variation) that can obscure phylogenetic signal. Simultaneously, these methods produce estimates of correlations between traits that are corrected for phylogenetic relationships among species. 3. We applied these methods to data for 13 morphological and physiological traits gathered in a common-garden study of nine species of Manglietia (Magnoliaceae). The 13 traits fell into four groups: three traits involved photosynthesis [maximum net photosynthesis (A(max)), light saturation point (LSP), light compensation point]; three described leaf morphology (thickness of leaves, palisade tissue, sponge tissue); four related to plant growth (basal stem diameter, crown volume, leaf area, relative growth rate); and three measured thermal tolerance [critical temperature (T-ch), peak temperature (T-max), temperature of half-inactivation (T-50)]. We also constructed a molecular phylogeny for these species from 219 AFLP markers via maximum likelihood estimation under the assumption of sequential binary changes in DNA sequences. 4. Of the 13 traits, only two photosynthesis traits (Amax and LSP) exhibited statistically detectable phylogenetic signal (P {\textless} 0.05) when analysed separately, whether using previously published univariate tests or our new univariate tests that incorporate measurement error. In contrast, multivariate analyses of the four trait groups, estimating simultaneously the phylogenetic signal for all traits and the correlations between traits, revealed a statistically significant phylogenetic signal for two of the four groups (photosynthesis and plant growth), comprising seven traits in total. 5. Our results demonstrate that even when the number of species in a comparative study is small, resulting in low power for univariate tests, phylogenetic signal can nonetheless be detected with multivariate tests that incorporate measurement error. Furthermore, our simulations show that the joint estimation of phylogenetic signal and trait correlations can lead to better (less biased and more precise) estimates of both.},

abstract = {We present a novel and straightforward method for estimating recent migration rates between discrete populations using multilocus genotype data. The approach builds upon a two-step sampling design, where individual genotypes are sampled before and after dispersal. We develop a model that estimates all pairwise backwards migration rates (m(ij), the probability that an individual sampled in population i is a migrant from population j) between a set of populations. The method is validated with simulated data and compared with the methods of BayesAss and Structure. First, we use data for an island model and then we consider more realistic data simulations for a metapopulation of the greater white-toothed shrew (Crocidura russula). We show that the precision and bias of estimates primarily depend upon the proportion of individuals sampled in each population. Weak sampling designs may particularly affect the quality of the coverage provided by 95{\%} highest posterior density intervals. We further show that it is relatively insensitive to the number of loci sampled and the overall strength of genetic structure. The method can easily be extended and makes fewer assumptions about the underlying demographic and genetic processes than currently available methods. It allows backwards migration rates to be estimated across a wide range of realistic conditions.},

Using the unparalleled fossil record of Cenozoic macroperforate planktonic foraminifera, we demonstrate that macroevolutionary dynamics depend on the interaction between species' ecology and the changing climate. This interplay drives diversification but differs between speciation probability and extinction risk: Speciation was more strongly shaped by diversity dependence than by climate change, whereas the reverse was true for extinction. Crucially, no single ecology was optimal in all environments, and species with distinct ecologies had significantly different probabilities of speciation and extinction. The ensuing macroevolutionary dynamics depend fundamentally on the ecological structure of species' assemblages.},

Dispersal ability, measured$\backslash$nin the laboratory as the lateral movement of propagules in the upper$\backslash$n5{\%} (right tail) of the distribution of distances, is inversely correlated$\backslash$n(rs = -0.94) with biomass abundance. Under constant conditions, seeds$\backslash$nof sparse species travel farther than seeds of common species. Dispersal$\backslash$nability is more closely related to a populational attribute (abundance)$\backslash$nthan to a more proximate characteristic (diaspore weight). Diaspore$\backslash$nweight is closely related (rs = 0.97) to culm biomass of the parent,$\backslash$nin apparently simple allometry, and more weakly related (rs = 0.71)$\backslash$nto biomass abundance. Large parents make large seeds. The sparsest$\backslash$nspecies, which is small in stature, has light (0.08 to 0.19 mg),$\backslash$nflattened diaspores with low terminal velocities (82 to 87 cm sec-1)$\backslash$nand achieves lateral movement (up to 460 mm) by tumbling and gliding.$\backslash$nSpecies of intermediate abundance have intermediate stature and diaspore$\backslash$nweight (1.0 to 1.8 mg), unornamented propagules, high terminal velocities$\backslash$n(191 to 209 cm sec-1) and intermediate dispersal ability (up to 388$\backslash$nmm).

Although the ornamentation slows$\backslash$nfall (96 to 194 cm sec-1), it acts as a "guide parachute," orienting$\backslash$nthe propagule so that it falls nearly straight downward. The common$\backslash$nspecies, which morphologically appear adapted to longer dispersal,$\backslash$nachieve little lateral movement (up to 235 mm) under laboratory conditions.$\backslash$nTerminal velocity is a misleading descriptor of dispersal because$\backslash$ndiaspores with similar terminal velocities have differing movement$\backslash$npatterns.

abstract = {Some of the most interesting but still most contentious disjunct biogeographical distributions involve Southern Hemisphere tropical and warm temperate families. The PHMV clade of Myrtales includes four families (Psiloxylaceae, Heteropyxidaceae, Myrtaceae, and Vochysiaceae) that exhibit a number of these biogeographical patterns. The related Psiloxylaceae and Heteropyxidaceae are small families restricted in distribution to the recent volcanic Mascarene Islands to the east of Madagascar and to southeast Africa, respectively. Myrtaceae are found on three major Gondwanan regions (South America, Australasia, and Africa). Because the New World taxa are almost exclusively fleshy fruited, it is unclear whether the family distribution is a classic Gondwanan vicariance pattern or results from one or more long-distance dispersal events over ocean barriers. The Vochysiaceae represent one of a handful of families with amphi-Atlantic distributions vigorously argued to support both long-distance dispersal over the Atlantic and vicariance of western Gondwanan biota by Atlantic seafloor spreading. Molecular phylogenetic relationships, fossil dating of nodes, and penalized likelihood rate smoothing of maximum likelihood trees were employed for a Myrtales- wide analysis using rbcL and ndhF and an analysis of the PHMV analysis using ndhF and matK. The results indicate that the PHMV differentiated during the late Cretaceous. The African lineage of Vochysiaceae is nested within a South American clade and probably arose via long-distance dispersal in the Oligocene at a time when the Atlantic had already rifted 80 m.yr. at the equatorial region. The African/Mascarene Island families, most closely related to Myrtaceae, differentiated during the late Eocene, with subsequent but recent long- distance dispersal from Africa to the Mascarenes. Myrtaceae show a rapid differentiation of a basal, paraphyletic subf. Leptospermoideae in Australasia. Fleshy-fruited taxa (subf. Myrtoideae) are not monophyletic. Vicariance of a widespread warm temperate Southern Hemisphere distribution is likely in explaining the South American–Australasian disjunction, with subsequent dispersal events between the two and to Africa and the Mediterranean basin.

Given a species pool, and measured traits for each species, the objective is to specify which traits (and therefore which subset of species) will occur in a particular environment. Because the problem primarily involves traits and environments, answers should be general-izable to systems with very different taxonomic composition. In this context, the environment functions like a filter (or sieve) removing all species lacking specified combinations of traits. In this way, assembly rules are a community level analogue of natural selection. Response rules follow a similar process except that they transform a vector of species abun-dances to a new vector using the same information. Examples already exist from a range of habitats, scales, and kinds of organisms.},

abstract = {Methods developed over the past decade have made it possible to estimate molecular demographic parameters such as effective population size, divergence time, and gene flow with unprecedented accuracy and precision. However, they make simplifying assumptions about certain aspects of the species' histories and the nature of the genetic data, and it is not clear how robust they are to violations of these assumptions. Here, we use simulated data sets to examine the effects of a number of violations of the "Isolation with Migration" (IM) model, including intralocus recombination, population structure, gene flow from an unsampled species, linkage among loci, and divergent selection, on demographic parameter estimates made using the program IMA. We also examine the effect of having data that fit a nucleotide substitution model other than the two relatively simple models available in IMA. We find that IMA estimates are generally quite robust to small to moderate violations of the IM model assumptions, comparable with what is often encountered in real-world scenarios. In particular, population structure within species, a condition encountered to some degree in virtually all species, has little effect on parameter estimates even for fairly high levels of structure. Likewise, most parameter estimates are robust to significant levels of recombination when data sets are pared down to apparently nonrecombining blocks, although substantial bias is introduced to several estimates when the entire data set with recombination is included. In contrast, a poor fit to the nucleotide substitution model can result in an increased error rate, in some cases due to a predictable bias and in other cases due to an increase in variance in parameter estimates among data sets simulated under the same conditions.},

abstract = {Only recently has the importance of positive interactions among plant species in structuring natural communities been supported by experimental evidence. Most studies have focused on interactions between a pair of species at a single life-history stage. In this study positive interactions between a woody nitrogen-fixing shrub (Myrica pensylvanica) and two herbaceous sand dune species (Solidcrgo sempervirens, Ammophila breviligulata) which frequently grow beneath shrub canopies are examined throughout the life cycles of the herbaceous species. Comparisons of S. sempervirens and A. breviligulata growing beneath and outside M. pensylvanica shrubs show that plants growing in association with shrubs are larger, are more likely to flower, produce greater numbers of flowers and seeds, have higher midday xylem water potentials, have higher tissue nitrogen concentrations. and have higher photosynthetic efficiencies. Measurements of environmental conditions show that areas beneath shrubs are more shaded. have lower soil temperatures, and have higher soil nitrogen levels. The results from experimental manipulations designed to test the effects of Myrica shrubs on understory species suggest that the observed differences in plant performance are strongly influenced by canopy shading and soil nutrient enrichment associated with the shrubs. The results demonstrate that M. pensylvanica facilitates growth, reproduction, and recruitment of S. sempervirens and A. breviligulata growing beneath it. This study, one of the few to examine positive interactions at different life-history stages, supports previous predictions that positive interactions may be particularly important in plant communities characterized by physiologically stressful conditions.},

We used five microsatellite loci to examine genetic variation in 14 natural populations (N = 478 individuals) of this vertebrate-dispersed rain forest tree species in Panama, Ecuador, and French Guiana. Estimates of genetic differentiation (F st and R st) were significant among all but one population pair and global differentiation was moderate (F st = 0.25, R st = 0.33) with 94{\%} of genetic variation ascribed to differences among three main geographic regions (Central America, Western Ecuador, Amazon basin). There was no evidence of isolation by distance within regions. Allele-size mutations contributed significantly (R ST {\textgreater} F ST) to the divergences between cis- and trans-Andean populations, highlighting the role of the northern Andean cordilleras as an important geographic barrier for this species.},

abstract = {Pachysandra is an eastern Asian-North American disjunct genus with three species, two in eastern Asia (Pachysandra axillaris and Pachysandra terminalis) and one in eastern North America (Pachysandra procumbens). Although morphological and cytological studies suggest a close affinity of P.procumbens with P axillaris, molecular data from nuclear and chloroplast DNA regions have provided conflicting signals. In this study, we tested previous phylogenetic hypotheses using sequences of nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacers and chloroplast ndhF gene from multiple individuals of each of the three species. We also estimated the time of divergence between eastern Asia and eastern North America. Our results support the morphological and cytological conclusion that P procumbens is more closely related to P axillaris than to P terminalis. The estimated time of divergence of P axillaris and P procumbens was 14.6+/-5.5 mya, consistent with estimates from many other eastern Asian-North American disjunct genera. The migration of Pachysandra populations from eastern Asia to North America might have occurred by way of the North Atlantic land bridge.},

abstract = {Conservation biologists and community ecologists have increasingly begun to quantify the phylogenetic diversity and phylogenetic dispersion in species assemblages. In some instances, the phylogenetic trees used for such analyses are fully bifurcating, but in many cases the phylogenies being used contain unresolved nodes (i.e. polytomies). The lack of phylogenetic resolution in such studies, while certainly not preferred, is likely to continue particularly for those analyzing diverse communities and datasets with hundreds to thousands of taxa. Thus it is imperative that we quantify potential biases and losses of statistical power in studies that use phylogenetic trees that are not completely resolved. The present study is designed to meet both of these goals by quantifying the phylogenetic diversity and dispersion of simulated communities using resolved and gradually 'unresolved' phylogenies. The results show that: (i) measures of community phylogenetic diversity and dispersion are generally more sensitive to loss of resolution basally in the phylogeny and less sensitive to loss of resolution terminally; and (ii) the loss of phylogenetic resolution generally causes false negative results rather than false positives.},

abstract = {Molecular phylogenetic studies have become a major area of interest in plant systematics, and their impacts on historical biogeographic hypotheses are not to be disregarded. In Brazil, most historical biogeographic studies have relied on animal phylogenies, whereas plant biogeographic studies have largely lacked a phylogenetic component, having a limited utility for historical biogeography. That country, however, is of great importance formost biogeographic studies of lowland tropical South America, and it includes areas from a number of biogeographic regions of the continent. Important biogeographic reports have been published as part of phylogenetic studies, taxonomic monographs, and regional accounts for small areas or phytogeographic domains, but the available information is subsequently scattered and sometimes hard to find. In this paper we review some relevant angiosperm biogeographic studies in Brazil. Initially we briefly discuss the importance of other continents as source areas for the South American flora. Then we present a subdivision of Brazil into phytogeographic domains, and we cite studies that have explored the detection of biogeographic units (areas of endemism) and how they are historically related among those domains. Examples of plant taxa that could be used to test some biogeographic hypotheses are provided throughout, as well as taxa that exemplify several patterns of endemism and disjunction in the Brazilian angiosperm flora},

The particular focus is on how such data sources and models can be coupled within a hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework. This framework, however, has been underutilized in physiological and ecosystem ecology, despite its great potential for data---model integration in these areas. This paper provides a summary of the use of Bayesian methods in ecological research and gives detailed examples highlighting existing and potential uses of Bayesian and hierarchical Bayesian methods in plant physiological and ecosystem ecology. This paper also provides an overview of the statistical theory underlying the development of hierarchical Bayesian methods for analyzing complex ecological problems. The methods are applied to specific examples that include a detailed illustration of a hierarchical Bayesian analysis of leaf-level gas exchange data that are integrated with models of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, and Bayesian approaches to estimating parameters in complex ecosystem simulation models. The paper concludes with some practical issues and thoughts on the direction of hierarchical Bayesian modeling in plant physiological and ecosystem ecology.},

We show that in Drosophila, narrow and wide ranges of desiccation and cold resistance are closely associated with the distributions of specialist and generalist species, respectively. Furthermore, our data show that narrowly distributed tropical species consistently have low means and low genetic variation for these traits as compared with those of widely distributed species after phylogenetic correction. These results are unrelated to levels of neutral variation. Thus, specialist species may simply lack genetic variation in key traits, limiting their ability to adapt to conditions beyond their current range. We predict that such species are likely to be constrained in their evolutionary responses to future climate changes.},

abstract = {Ecologists seek general explanations for the dramatic variation in species abundances in space and time. An increasingly popular solution is to predict species distributions, dynamics, and responses to environmental change based on easily measured anatomical and morphological traits. Trait-based approaches assume that simple functional traits influence fitness and life history evolution, but rigorous tests of this assumption are lacking, because they require quantitative information about the full lifecycles of many species representing different life histories. Here, we link a global traits database with empirical matrix population models for 222 species and report strong relationships between functional traits and plant life histories. Species with large seeds, long-lived leaves, or dense wood have slow life histories, with mean fitness (i.e., population growth rates) more strongly influenced by survival than by growth or fecundity, compared with fast life history species with small seeds, short-lived leaves, or soft wood. In contrast to measures of demographic contributions to fitness based on whole lifecycles, analyses focused on raw demographic rates may underestimate the strength of association between traits and mean fitness. Our results help establish the physiological basis for plant life history evolution and show the potential for trait-based approaches in population dynamics.},

abstract = {The adverse influence of habitat degradation on the survival of populations may sometimes be amplified by rapid evolution over ecological timescales. This phenomenon of "evolutionary suicide" has been described in theoretical as well as empirical studies. However, no studies have suggested that habitat improvement could possibly also trigger an evolutionary response that would result in a decline in population size. We use individual-based simulations to demonstrate the potential for such a paradoxical response. An increase in the quality, size, or stability of only a fraction of the habitat patches in a metapopulation may result in an evolutionary decline in the dispersal propensity of individuals, followed by a decrease in recolonization, a reduction in the number of patches occupied, a decline in overall population size, and even extinction. Thus, well-intended conservation efforts that ignore potential evolutionary consequences of habitat management may increase the extinction risk of populations.},

abstract = {In this study we analyzed the phylogeographic pattern and historical demography of an endemic Atlantic forest (AF) bird, Basileuterus leucoblepharus, and test the influence of the last glacial maximum (LGM) on its population effective size using coalescent simulations. We address two main questions: (i) Does B. leucoblepharus present population genetic structure congruent with the patterns observed for other AF organisms? (ii) How did the LGM affect the effective population size of B. leucoblepharus? We sequenced 914bp of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b and 512bp of the nuclear intron 5 of beta-fibrinogen of 62 individuals from 15 localities along the AF. Both molecular markers revealed no genetic structure in B. leucoblepharus. Neutrality tests based on both loci showed significant demographic expansion. The extended Bayesian skyline plot showed that the species seems to have experienced demographic expansion starting around 300,000years ago, during the late Pleistocene. This date does not coincide with the LGM and the dynamics of population size showed stability during the LGM. To further test the effect of the LGM on this species, we simulated seven demographic scenarios to explore whether populations suffered specific bottlenecks. The scenarios most congruent with our data were population stability during the LGM with bottlenecks older than this period. This is the first example of an AF organism that does not show phylogeographic breaks caused by vicariant events associated to climate change and geotectonic activities in the Quaternary. Differential ecological, environmental tolerances and habitat requirements are possibly influencing the different evolutionary histories of these organisms. Our results show that the history of organism diversification in this megadiverse Neotropical forest is complex.},

They share with the corn chloroplast genome a large inversion of ???50 kb relative to the genomes of three legumes-mung bean, pea and broad bean. There is one additional rearrangement, a second, smaller inversion within the 50 kb inversion, which is specific to the corn genome. These two changes are the only detectable rearrangements that have occurred during the evolution of the species examined (corn, spinach, petunia, cucumber and mung bean) whose chloroplast genomes contain a large inverted repeat sequence of 22-25 kb. In contrast, we find extensive sequence rearrangements in comparing the pea and broad bean genomes, both of which have deleted one entire segment of the inverted repeat, and also in comparing each of these to the mung bean genome. Thus there is a relatively stable arrangement of sequences in those genomes with the inverted repeat and a much more dynamic arrangement in those that have lost it. We discuss several explanations for this correlation, including the possibility that the inverted repeat may play a direct role in maintaining a conserved arrangement of chloroplast DNA sequences. ?? 1982.},

Here, we provide theoretical predictions for phylogenetic analogues of the species–area and distance–decay relationships. We use a random model of community assembly and a spatially explicit flora dataset collected in four Mediterranean-type regions to provide theoretical predictions for the increase in phylogenetic diversity – the total phylogenetic branch-length separating a set of species – with increasing area and the decay in phylogenetic similarity with geographic separation.

For example, of the methods currently available for estimating species trees from multilocus data, the Bayesian method introduced by Liu and Pearl (2007; BEST) is the only one that provides nodal support values. Using gene sequences from five nuclear loci, we explored two analytical methods (deep coalescence and BEST) to reconstruct the species tree of the five primary Manacus OTUs: M. aurantiacus, M. candei, M. vitellinus, populations of M. manacus from west of the Andes (M. manacus (w)), and populations of M. manacus from east of the Andes (M. manacus (e)). Both BEST and deep coalescence supported a sister relationship between M. vitellinus and M. manacus (w). A lower probability tree from the BEST analysis and one of the most parsimonious deep coalescence trees also supported a sister relationship between M. candei and M. aurantiacus. Because hybrid zones connect the distributions of most Manacus species, we examined the potential influence of post-divergence gene flow on the sister relationship of parapatrically distributed M. vitellinus and M. manacus (w). An isolation-with-migration (IM) analysis found relatively high levels of gene flow between M. vitellinus and M. manacus (w). Whether the gene flow is obscuring a true sister relationship between M. manacus (w) and M. manacus (e) remained unclear, pointing to the need for more detailed models accommodating multispecies, multilocus DNA sequence data.},

abstract = {Many willow species (genus: Salix) co-occur within habitats ($\alpha$-diversity) and across the landscape ($\beta$-diversity) throughout North America. This high diversity is challenging to explain because closely related species often share similar functional traits and thus experience heightened competition and shared pest and pathogen susceptibility. To investigate whether traits related to drought survival are important in maintaining diversity, we conducted an experimental dry-down on six willow species in a greenhouse. We compared species' growth rates, stem and leaf hydraulics, leaf function and dieback and examined potential associations between their drought responses and habitat affinities. Habitat affinities were characterized based on species occurrence in randomly established field plots in central Minnesota. Overall, species that occur in drier, more seasonally variable habitats tended to have higher water-use efficiency, and faster growth rates than species from wetter habitats. However, the greatest difference in drought survival strategies was found between two species with similar habitat affinities. We conclude that differences in willow species could be important in both driving habitat differentiation and permitting temporal differentiation in resource utilization within habitats. Therefore, species' water-use strategies could be important in maintaining both $\alpha$- and $\beta$-diversity across the landscape.},

The extensive interspecific hybridization and high morphological diversity in this group pose difficulties in identifying taxonomic units for comparative evolutionary studies and systematics. To understand the evolutionary relationships among poplars and to provide a framework for biosystematic classification, we reconstructed a phylogeny of the genus Populus based on nucleotide sequences of three noncoding regions of the chloroplast DNA (intron of trnL and intergenic regions of trnT-trnL and trnL-trnF) and ITS1 and ITS2 of the nuclear rDNA. The resulting phylogenetic trees showed polyphyletic relationships among species in the sections Tacamahaca and Aigeiros. Based on chloroplast DNA sequence data, P. nigra had a close affinity to species of section Populus, whereas nuclear DNA sequence data suggested a close relationship between P. nigra and species of the section Aigeiros, suggesting a possible hybrid origin for P. nigra. Similarly, the chloroplast DNA sequences of P. tristis and P. szechuanica were similar to that of the species of section Aigeiros, while the nuclear sequences revealed a close affinity to species of the section Tacamahaca, suggesting a hybrid origin for these two Asiatic balsam poplars. The incongruence between phylogenetic trees based on nuclear- and chloroplast-DNA sequence data suggests a reticulate evolution in the genus Populus.},

A high-resolution pollen record from northern Brazil demonstrates a significant abrupt and rapid environmental change associated with the Northern Hemisphere Younger Dryas temperature reversal. This finding is consistent with the model in which the Younger Dryas had a stronger influence on temperature in the Northern Hemisphere than south of the equator because of the larger temperature gradient between pole and equator in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere. One consequence of the Younger Dryas changes would be the location of the Intertropical Convergence Zone in a southern position, so that even tropical regions would have been under Arctic influence.},

abstract = {Frugivores are highly variable in their contribution to fruit removal in plant populations. However, data are lacking on species-specific variation in two central aspects of seed dispersal, distance of dispersal and probability of dispersal among populations through long-distance transport. We used DNA-based genotyping techniques on Prunus mahaleb seeds dispersed by birds (small- and medium-sized passerines) and carnivorous mammals to infer each seed's source tree, dispersal distance, and the probability of having originated from outside the study population. Small passerines dispersed most seeds short distances (50{\%} dispersed {\textless}51 m from source trees) and into covered microhabitats. Mammals and medium-sized birds dispersed seeds long distances (50{\%} of mammals dispersed seeds {\textgreater}495 m, and 50{\%} of medium-sized birds dispersed seeds to {\textgreater}110 m) and mostly into open microhabitats. Thus, dispersal distance and microhabitat of seed deposition were linked through the contrasting behaviors of different frugivores. When the quantitative contribution to fruit removal was accounted for, mammals were responsible for introducing two-thirds of the immigrant seeds into the population, whereas birds accounted for one-third. Our results demonstrate that frugivores differ widely in their effects on seed-mediated gene flow. Despite highly diverse coteries of mutualistic frugivores dispersing seeds, critical long-distance dispersal events might rely on a small subset of large species. Population declines of these key frugivore species may seriously impair seed-mediated gene flow in fragmented landscapes by truncating the long-distance events and collapsing seed arrival to a restricted subset of available microsites.},

abstract = {One of the most pervasive concepts in the study of community assembly is the metaphor of the environmental filter, which refers to abiotic factors that prevent the establishment or persistence of species in a particular location. The metaphor has its origins in the study of community change during succession and in plant community dynamics, although it has gained considerable attention recently as part of a surge of interest in functional trait and phylogenetic-based approaches to the study of communities. While the filtering metaphor has clear utility in some circumstances, it has been challenging to reconcile the environmental filtering concept with recent developments in ecological theory related to species coexistence. These advances suggest that the evidence used in many studies to assess environmental filtering is insufficient to distinguish filtering from the outcome of biotic interactions. We re-examine the environmental filtering metaphor from the perspective of coexistence theory. In an effort to move the discussion forward, we present a simple framework for considering the role of the environment in shaping community membership, review the literature to document the evidence typically used in environmental filtering studies and highlight research challenges to address in coming years. The current usage of the environmental filtering term in empirical studies likely overstates the role abiotic tolerances play in shaping community structure. We recommend that the term ‘environmental filtering' only be used to refer to cases where the abiotic environment prevents establishment or persistence in the absence of biotic interactions, although only 15{\%} of the studies in our review presented such evidence. Finally, we urge community ecologists to consider additional mechanisms aside from environmental filtering by which the abiotic environment can shape community pattern.},

We studied 11 cave and 10 surface populations of Astyanax mexicanus in order to better understand the evolutionary origins of the cave forms, the basic genetic structuring of both cave and surface populations, and the degree to which present day migration among them affects their genetic divergence.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: To assess the genetic structure within populations and the relationships among them we genotyped individuals at 26 microsatellite loci. We found that surface populations are similar to one another, despite their relatively large geographic separation, whereas the cave populations are better differentiated. The cave populations we studied span the full range of the cave forms in three separate geographic regions and have at least five separate evolutionary origins. Cave populations had lower genetic diversity than surface populations, correlated with their smaller effective population sizes, probably the result of food and space limitations. Some of the cave populations receive migrants from the surface and exchange migrants with one another, especially when geographically close. This admixture results in significant heterozygote deficiencies at numerous loci due to Wahlund effects. Cave populations receiving migrants from the surface contain small numbers of individuals that are intermediate in both phenotype and genotype, affirming at least limited gene flow from the surface.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Cave populations of this species are derived from two different surface stocks denoted "old" and "new." The old stock colonized caves at least three times independently while the new stock colonized caves at least twice independently. Thus, the similar cave phenotypes found in these caves are the result of repeated convergences. These phenotypic convergences have occurred in spite of gene flow from surface populations suggesting either strong natural or sexual selection for alleles responsible for the cave phenotype in the cave environment.},

abstract = {The perceived threat of climate change is often evaluated from species distribution models that are fitted to many species independently and then added together. This approach ignores the fact that species are jointly distributed and limit one another. Species respond to the same underlying climatic variables, and the abundance of any one species can be constrained by competition; a large increase in one is inevitably linked to declines of others. Omitting this basic relationship explains why responses modeled independently do not agree with the species richness or basal areas of actual forests. We introduce a joint species distribution modeling approach (JSDM), which is unique in three ways, and apply it to forests of eastern North America. First, it accommodates the joint distribution of species. Second, this joint distribution includes both abundance and presence–absence data. We solve the common issue of large numbers of zeros in abundance data by accommodating zeros in both stem counts and basal area...},

Our analysis of chloroplast genes in legume species that have an IR shows that the synonymous (silent) substitution rate in IR genes is 2.3-fold lower than in single-copy (SC) genes, which is largely in agreement with earlier findings. Given that all genes in species that lack the IR are single-copy, what level of synonymous substitution exists in these genes? We report a uniform substitution rate in IR-less genomes, and moreover, we find this rate to be at the level otherwise reserved for SC genes. In other words, the synonymous substitution rate has accelerated in the remaining copy of the duplicate region. We propose that this acceleration is a direct result of the decrease in the copy number of the sequence, rather than an intrinsic property of the genes normally located in the IR.},

abstract = {Genetic recombination associated with sexual reproduction is expected to have important consequences for the effectiveness of natural selection. These effects may be evident within genomes, in the form of contrasting patterns of molecular variation and evolution in regions with different levels of recombination. Previous work reveals patterns that are consistent with a benefit of recombination for adaptation at the level of protein sequence: both positive selection for adaptive variants and purifying selection against deleterious ones appear to be compromised in regions of low recombination [1-11]. Here, we re-examine these patterns by using polymorphism and divergence data from the Drosophila dot chromosome, which has a long history of reduced recombination. To avoid confounding selection and demographic effects, we collected these data from a species with an apparently stable demographic history, Drosophila americana. We find that D. americana dot loci show several signatures of ineffective purifying and positive selection, including an increase in the rate of protein evolution, an increase in protein polymorphism, and a reduction in the proportion of amino acid substitutions attributable to positive selection. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We show that these traits are approximately distributed proportional to leaf area instead of mass, as expected for a light- and carbon dioxide-collecting organ. Much of the structure in the mass-normalized LES results from normalizing area-proportional traits by mass. Mass normalization induces strong correlations among area-proportional traits because of large variation among species in leaf mass per area (LMA). The high LMA variance likely reflects its functional relationship with leaf life span. A LES that is independent of mass- or area-normalization and LMA reveals physiological relationships that are inconsistent with those in global vegetation models designed to address climate change.},

abstract = {Abstract The structure of the living Patagonian flora, dominated by the steppe, is a direct consequence of past climatic and tectonic events. These arid-adapted communities were widespread during the Late Neogene, but their origin in Patagonia can be traced back to the Paleogene. Vegetational trends throughout Paleocene-Miocene time are based on available paleobotanical and palynological information. Four major supported stages in vegetation turnovers are recognized: (1) Paleocene and Early Eocene floras were rainforest-dominated, including many angiosperms with warm-temperate affinities (e.g., palms, Juglandaceae, Casuarinaceae). However, mainly in the Early Eocene, some geographic areas influenced by warm but drier conditions are suggested by the occurrence of certain taxa (e.g., Anacardiaceae). These areas containing arid-adapted floras would have arisen in Patagonian inland regions, in a generally wet continent. (2) The Middle Eocene-Early Oligocene interval was distinguished by the invasion ofNothofagus forests. Progressive replacements of megathermal communities by meso- and microthermal rainforest are documented.Nothofagus forest expansion suggests a marked cooling trend at this time, although some megathermal elements (AquifoliaceaeIlex, Tiliaceae-Bombacaceae, Sapindaceae) were still present at the beginning of this period. Arid-loving taxa have not been recorded in abundance. (3) Late Oligocene-Early Miocene floras were characterized by the occurrence of shrubby-herbaceous elements belonging to Asteraceae, Chenopodiaceae, Ephedraceae, Convolvulaceae, Fabaceae, and Poaceae. They began to give a modern appearance to plant communities. Xerophytic formations would have occupied coastal salt marshes and pockets in inland areas. Megathermal angiosperms of the Rubiaceae, Combretaceae, Sapindaceae, Chloranthaceae, and Arecaceae occurred mainly during the Late Oligocene. Forests of Nothofagaceae, Podocarpaceae, and Araucariaceae are still documented in extra-Andean Patagonia; however, a contrast between coastal and inland environments may have developed, particularly in the Miocene. (4) Middle-Late Miocene records show an increasing diversity and abundance of xerophytic-adapted taxa, including Asteraceae, Chenopodiaceae, and ConvolvulaceaeCressa/Wilsonia. Expansion of these xerophytic taxa, coupled with extinctions of megathermal/nonseasonal elements, would have been associated with both tectonic and climatic forcing factors, led to the development of aridity and extreme seasonality. These arid-adapted Late Miocene floras are closely related to modern communities, with steppe widespread across extra-Andean Patagonia and forest restricted to the western humid upland regions.},

abstract = {The relative importance of equilibrium and nonequilibrium processes in shaping patterns of species richness is one of the most fundamental questions in biodiversity studies. If equilibrium processes predominate, then ecological interactions presumably limit species diversity, potentially through diversity dependence of immigration, speciation, and extinction rates. Alternatively, species richness may be limited by the rate at which diversity arises or by the amount of time available for diversification. These latter explanations constitute nonequilibrium processes and can apply only to biotas that are unsaturated or far from diversity equilibria. Recent studies have challenged whether equilibrium models apply to biotas assembled through in situ speciation, as this process may be too slow to achieve steady-state diversities. Here we demonstrate that speciation rates in replicate Caribbean lizard radiations have undergone parallel declines to equilibrium conditions on three of four major islands. Our results suggest that feedback between total island diversity and per-capita speciation rates scales inversely with island area, with proportionately greater declines occurring on smaller islands. These results are consistent with strong ecological controls on species richness and suggest that the iconic adaptive radiation of Caribbean anoles may have reached an endpoint.},

abstract = {Historical climate changes have had a major effect on the distribution and evolution of plant species in the neotropics. What is more controversial is whether relatively recent Pleistocene climatic changes have driven speciation, or whether neotropical species diversity is more ancient. This question is addressed using evolutionary rate analysis of sequence data of nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacers in diverse taxa occupying neotropical seasonally dry forests, including Ruprechtia (Polygonaceae), robinioid legumes (Fabaceae), Chaetocalyx and Nissolia (Fabaceae), and Loxopterygium (Anacardiaceae). Species diversifications in these taxa occurred both during and before the Pleistocene in Central America, but were primarily pre-Pleistocene in South America. This indicates plausibility both for models that predict tropical species diversity to be recent and that invoke a role for Pleistocene climatic change, and those that consider it ancient and implicate geological factors such as the Andean orogeny and the closure of the Panama Isthmus. Cladistic vicariance analysis was attempted to identify common factors underlying evolution in these groups. In spite of the similar Mid-Miocene to Pliocene ages of the study taxa, and their high degree of endemism in the different fragments of South American dry forests, the analysis yielded equivocal, non-robust patterns of area relationships.},

abstract = {This study develops the random phylogenies rate test (RAPRATE), a likelihood method that simulates morphological evolution along randomly generated phylogenies, and uses it to determine whether a considerable difference in morphological diversity between two sister clades of South American fishes should be taken as evidence of differing rates of morphological change or lineage turnover. Despite identical ages of origin, similar species richness, and sympatric geographic distributions, the morphological and ecological diversity of the superfamily Anostomoidea exceeds that of the Curimatoidea. The test shows with 90{\%} confidence (using variance among species as the measure of morphological diversity) or 99{\%} confidence (using volume of occupied morphospace) that the rate of morphological change per unit time in the Anostomoidea likely exceeded that of the Curimatoidea. Variation in the rate of lineage turnover (speciation and extinction rates) is not found to affect greatly the morphological diversity of simulated clades and is not a likely explanation of the observed difference in morphological diversity in this case study. Though a 17{\%} or greater delay in the onset of diversification in the Curimatoidea remains a possible alternative explanation of unequal morphological diversification, further simulations suggest that two clades drawn from the possible treespace of the Anostomoidea and Curimatoidea will rarely differ so greatly in the onset of diversification. Several uniquely derived morphological and ecological features of the Anostomoidea and Curimatoidea may have accelerated or decelerated their rate of morphological change, including a marked lengthening of the quadrate that may have relaxed structural constraints on the evolution of the anostomoid jaw.},

Lower thresholds of 15, 7 and 5 repeat units were used to define microsatellites of the mono-, di-, and tri- to hexanucleotide repeat type, respectively. Based on these criteria, 696 SSRs were identified among 3,389 EST unigenes, together representing 2,840 kb. This corresponds to an average density of one SSR every 4.1 kb of non-redundant EST sequences. Dinucleotide repeats were most abundant (38.4{\%} of all SSRs) followed by trinucleotide repeats (38.1{\%}). Flanking primer pairs were designed for 537 EST-SSR loci, and 49 of these were screened for their functionality in 12 accessions of A. comosus, 14 accessions of 5 additional Ananas species and 1 species of Pseudananas. Distinct PCR products of the expected size range were obtained with 36 primer pairs. Eighteen loci analyzed in more detail were all polymorphic in pineapple, and primer pairs flanking these loci also generated PCR products from a wide range of genera and species from six subfamilies of the Bromeliaceae.

The Arabidopsis genome possesses {\textgreater}600 RLK-encoding genes, some of which are implicated in the perception of environmental signals during the life cycle of the sessile plants. Histidine kinases are also membrane-localized kinases and perceive osmotic stress and plant hormones.

We summarize our recent understanding of their specific roles in stress responses and absicisic acid (ABA) regulation. Elucidation of the functions of these kinases in the osmotic stress response will provide a better understanding of stress-sensing mechanisms in plants and help to identify potential candidate genes for genetic engineering of improved stress-tolerant crops.},

Recent technological advances for assessing optical properties of plants offer opportunities to detect functional traits of organisms and differentiate levels of biological organization across the tree of life. Here we connect leaf-level full range spectral data (400-2400 nm) of leaves to the hierarchical organization of plant diversity within the oak genus (Quercus) using field and greenhouse experiments in which environmental factors and plant age are controlled. We show that spectral data significantly differentiate populations within a species and that spectral similarity is significantly associated with phylogenetic similarity among species. We further show that hyperspectral information allows more accurate classification of taxa than spectrally-derived traits, which by definition are of lower dimensionality. Finally, model accuracy increases at higher levels in the hierarchical organization of plant diversity, such that we are able to better distinguish clades than species or populations. This pattern supports an evolutionary explanation for the degree of optical differentiation among plants and demonstrates potential for remote detection of genetic and phylogenetic diversity.},

abstract = {Until now, Quaternary paleoecologists have regarded evolution as a slow process relative to climate change, predicting that the primary biotic response to changing climate is not adaptation, but instead (1) persistence in situ if changing climate remains within the species' tolerance limits, (2) range shifts (migration) to regions where climate is currently within the species' tolerance limits, or (3) extinction. We argue here that all three of these outcomes involve evolutionary processes. Genetic differentiation within species is ubiquitous, commonly via adaptation of populations to differing environmental conditions. Detectable adaptive divergence evolves on a time scale comparable to change in climate, within decades for herbaceous plant species, and within centuries or millennia for longer-lived trees, implying that biologically significant evolutionary response can accompany temporal change in climate. Models and empirical studies suggest that the speed with which a population adapts to a changing environment affects invasion rate of new habitat and thus migration rate, population growth rate and thus probability of extinction, and growth and mortality of individual plants and thus productivity of regional vegetation. Recent models and experiments investigate the stability of species tolerance limits, the influence of environmental gradients on marginal populations, and the interplay of demography, gene flow, mutation rate, and other genetic processes on the rate of adaptation to changed environments. New techniques enable ecologists to document adaptation to changing conditions directly by resurrecting ancient populations from propagules buried in decades-old sediment. Improved taxonomic resolution from morphological studies of macrofossils and DNA recovered from pollen grains and macroremains provides additional information on range shifts, changes in population sizes, and extinctions. Collaboration between paleoecologists and evolutionary biologists can refine interpretations of paleorecords, and improve predictions of biotic response to anticipated climate change.},

We also plotted 12 non-molecular characters onto molecular phylogenies. Chloroplast DNA trees are incongruent with those from nuclear regions, as are most nuclear regions with one another. Some of this conflict may be the result of hybridization, which occurs between many genera of Pyrinae in the present and may have occurred in the past, and duplication of nuclear loci. Sequence divergence between genera of Pyrinae, which is significantly less than that between genera of another large clade in Rosaceae, the Rosoideae, is concentrated in terminal branches, with short internal branches. This pattern is consistent with an ancient, rapid radiation, which has also been hypothesized from the fossil record. Even with about 500,000 bp of sequence, our results resolve only several small groups of genera and leave much uncertainty about phylogenetic relationships within Pyrinae.},

abstract = {Model-based analyses of natural selection often categorize sites into a relatively small number of site classes. Forcing each site to belong to one of these classes places unrealistic constraints on the distribution of selection parameters, which can result in misleading inference due to model misspecification. We present an approximate hierarchical Bayesian method using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) routine that ensures robustness against model misspecification by averaging over a large number of predefined site classes. This leaves the distribution of selection parameters essentially unconstrained, and also allows sites experiencing positive and purifying selection to be identified orders of magnitude faster than by existing methods. We demonstrate that popular random effects likelihood methods can produce misleading results when sites assigned to the same site class experience different levels of positive or purifying selection--an unavoidable scenario when using a small number of site classes. Our Fast Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation (FUBAR) is unaffected by this problem, while achieving higher power than existing unconstrained (fixed effects likelihood) methods. The speed advantage of FUBAR allows us to analyze larger data sets than other methods: We illustrate this on a large influenza hemagglutinin data set (3,142 sequences). FUBAR is available as a batch file within the latest HyPhy distribution (http://www.hyphy.org), as well as on the Datamonkey web server (http://www.datamonkey.org/).},

abstract = {The ndhF sequences of 99 taxa, representing all sections in extant Magnoliaceae, were analyzed to address phylogenetic questions in the family. Magnolia macrophylla and M. dealbata, North American species of Magnolia section Rytidospermum, are placed at the base in the subfamily Magnolioideae although its supporting value is low. In the remaining taxa, several distinctive lineages are recognized: (1) Magnolia, the biggest genus in the family, is not monophyletic; (2) Michelia, including section Maingola of Magnolia subgenus Magnolia, is closely related with Elmerrillia and sections Alcimandra and Aromadendron of Magnolia subgenus Magnolia; (3) the associates of Michelia are grouped with Magnolia subgenus Yulania and section Gynopodium of Magnolia subgenus Magnolia; (4) Pachylarnax forms a clade with sections Manglietiastrum and Gynopodium of Magnolia; (5) a well-supported Manglietia clade is recognized; (6) Caribbean species of section Theorhodon of Magnolia subgenus Magnolia, which are section Splendentes sensu V{\'{a}}zquez-Garcia, are closely allied with New World members of Magnolia subgenus Talauma; and (7) section Rytidospermum of Magnolia subgenus Magnolia and subgenus Talauma are polyphyletic. The separated clades in the molecular tree are considerably different from traditional taxonomic dispositions in the family. The molecular data strongly suggest that a taxonomic realignment of infrafamilial delimitations and compositions should be considered.},

abstract = {The Amazon lowland rainforest flora is conventionally viewed as comprising lineages that evolved in biogeographic isolation after the split of west Gondwana (ca. 100 Myr ago). Recent molecular phylogenies, however, identify immigrant lineages that arrived in South America during its period of oceanic isolation (ca. 100-3 Myr ago). Long-distance sweepstakes dispersal across oceans played an important and possibly predominant role. Stepping-stone migration from Africa and North America through hypothesized Late Cretaceous and Tertiary island chains may have facilitated immigration. An analysis of inventory plot data suggests that immigrant lineages comprise ca. 20{\%} of both the species and individuals of an Amazon tree community in Ecuador. This is more than an order of magnitude higher than previous estimates. We also present data on the community-level similarity between South American and palaeotropical rainforests, and suggest that most taxonomic similarity derives from trans-oceanic dispersal, rather than a shared Gondwanan history.},

abstract = {The center of diversity is not necessarily the place of origin, as has been established by many plant molecular phylogenies. Picea is a complicated but very important genus in coniferous forests of the Northern Hemisphere, with a high species diversity in Asia. Its phylogeny and biogeography were investigated here using sequence analysis of the paternally inherited chloroplast trnC-trnD and trnT-trnF regions and the maternally inherited mitochondrial nad5 intron 1. We found that the North American P. breweriana and P. sitchensis were basal to the other spruces that were further divided into three clades in the cpDNA phylogeny, and that the New World species habored four of five mitotypes detected, including two ancestral ones and three endemics. These results, combined with biogeographic analyses using DIVA and MacClade and fossil evidence, suggest that Picea originated in North America, and that its present distribution could stem from two times of dispersal from North America to Asia by the Beringian land bridge, and then from Asia to Europe. Most of the northeastern Asian species and the European P. abies could arise from a recent radiation given the very low interspecific genetic differentiation and pure mitotype of them. Considering that the ancestral mtDNA polymorphism can be preserved in many descendant species, even distantly related ones, we suggest that more species, at least the closely related ones, should be sampled in the phylogeographical study using cytoplasmic haplotypes if possible. In addition, we also discussed the evolution and phylogenetic utility of morphological characters in Picea. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = { Acer  is  one  of  the  most  diverse  woody  genera  in  the  Northern  Hemisphere.  Recent  phylogenetic  studies  support  the  placement  of  Acer  and  Dipteronia—sole  members  of  the  traditional  Aceraceae—in  the Sapindaceae. However, the monophyly of Acer and its sections remain to be tested. In this study, sequences of two chloroplast non-coding regions, psbM-trnD and trnD-trnT, are used to elucidate phylogenetic relationships of Acer and Dipteronia. Our results support the monophyly of Acer and sects. Arguta, Ginnala, Integrifolia, Lithocarpa, Macrantha, Palmata, Platanoidea, and Trifoliata. In contrast, sects. Acer, Goniocarpa, Parviflora, Saccharodendron,  and  Spicata  are  not  monophyletic.  Acer  trautvetteri  and  A.  opalus  of  sect.  Acer  are  more closely related to A. monspessulanum of sect. Goniocarpa and A. saccharum of sect. Saccharina than to A. caesium and A. pseudoplatanus of sect. Acer. Acer distylium of sect. Parviflora is more closely related to sect. Platanoidea than to A. nipponicum of sect. Parviflora. Morphological species pairs between eastern Asia and North America are not sister species, including A. pycnanthum—A. rubrum and A. caudatum—A. spicatum. Acer ukurunduense is a distinct species from A. caudatum. Acer glabrum is most closely related to A. pseudoplatanus, whereas A. spicatum may be more closely related to A. carpinifolium than to A. caudatum. Section Hyptiocarpa is  most  closely  related  to  sect.  Rubra, and  the  two  North American  species  of  sect.  Rubra (A.  rubrum and  A. saccharinum) are more closely related to each other than they are to the Japanese species (A. pycnanthum). Sections Integrifolia and Trifoliata are closely related, and so are Cissifolia and Arguta. Nevertheless, more data are needed to fully resolve intersectional relationships of Acer.},

abstract = {Leaf mass per area (LMA) is one of the most widely measured of all plant functional traits. In deciduous forests, there is similarity between plastic and evolutionary responses of LMA to light gradients. In evergreens, however, LMA is lower in shaded than sunlit individuals of the same species, whereas shade-tolerant evergreens have higher LMA than light-demanders grown under the same conditions. We suggest that this pattern of 'counter-gradient variation' results from some combination of (i) close evolutionary coordination of LMA with leaf lifespan, (ii) selection for different leaf constitutions (relative investment in cell walls versus cell contents) in sun and shade environments and/or (iii) constraints on plasticity as a result of genetic correlations between phenotypes expressed in sun and shade. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Based on nuclear and chloroplast sequences we resolve species relationships in Calycanthaceae and develop a biogeographic hypothesis that explains their intercontinental disjunctions and intra-continental diversification in eastern Asia. Fossil-calibrated penalized likelihood and Bayesian divergence time estimates indicate that the Northern Hemisphere Calycanthus and Chimonanthus diverged from each other in the mid-Miocene, while the Australian Idiospermum had already diverged by the Upper Cretaceous and likely represents a remnant of a former Gondwanan distribution of Calycanthaceae that included South America, as indicated by the occurrence of Cretaceous Calycanthaceae fossils in Brazil. Relationships within Calycanthus were difficult to resolve, but a shared 155-bp deletion in the trnL-F intergenic spacer unites the two North American species, which were also sisters in a cpDNA restriction site study. Their ancestor apparently crossed the Bering land bridge in the Miocene. The six species of Chimonanthus, by contrast, diverged from each other as recently as 1-2 my ago, and a DIVA analysis with four areas of endemism recognized within China suggests three vicariance and two dispersal events within Chimonanthus, with initial vicariance having occurred between eastern and southwestern or central China. Further divergence then appears to have involved eastern and southcentral China, and southwestern and central China. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Although polyphyly of Osmanthus has been suggested by different authors, the conclusions of previous studies have lacked robust support due to limited sampling or a paucity of phylogenetic characters. In this study, the phylogeny of Osmanthus was explored using sequences of three informative chloroplast regions (psbJ-petA, rpl32-trnL and rps16-trnQ), including all the five sections of the genus and eight closely related genera. The results confirm that Osmanthus, as presently circumscribed, is a polyphyletic group, containing three or four distinct lineages, i.e. sect. Leiolea (lineage I), sect. Notosmanthus (lineage III), sects. Osmanthus (excluding O. decorus), Siphosmanthus and Linocieroides (lineage IV), and an uncertain lineage including only O. decorus (lineage II). These results emphasize that the generic delimitation within subtribe Oleinae is in need of revision. In addition, this study found that the four cultivar groups of sweet osmanthus formed a paraphyletic clade, implying that cultivated sweet osmanthus might originate from several species.},

abstract = {Macaranga and Mallotus (Euphorbiaceae s.s.) are two closely related, large paleo(sub)tropical genera. To investigate the phylogenetic relationships between and within them and to determine the position of related genera belonging to the subtribe Rottlerinae, we sequenced one plastid (trnL-F) and three nuclear (ITS, ncpGS, phyC) markers for species representative of these genera. The analyses demonstrated the monophyly of Macaranga and the paraphyly of Mallotus and revealed three highly supported main clades. The genera Cordemoya and Deuteromallotus and the Mallotus sections Hancea and Oliganthae form a basal Cordemoya s.l. clade. The two other clades, the Macaranga clade and the Mallotus s.s. clade (the latter with Coccoceras, Neotrewia, Octospermum, and Trewia), are sister groups. In the Macaranga clade, two basal lineages (comprising mostly sect. Pseudorottlera) and a crown group with three geographically homogenous main clades were identified. The phylogeny of the Mallotus s.s. clade is less clear because of internal conflict in all four data sets. Many of the sections and informal infrageneric groups of Macaranga and Mallotus do not appear to be monophyletic. In both the Macaranga and Mallotus s.s. clades, the African and/or Madagascan taxa are nested in Asian clades, suggesting migrations or dispersals from Asia to Africa and Madagascar.},

abstract = {Aim The aim of this paper is to evaluate the combined effects of geographical distance and environmental distance on patterns of species similarity (similarity in species composition between sites), and to identify factors affecting the rate of decay in species similarity with each type of distance. Location Israel. Methods Data on species composition of land snails and land birds were recorded in 27 sites of 1 x 1 km scattered across a rainfall gradient in Israel. Matrices of similarity in species composition between all pairs of sites were computed and analysed with respect to corresponding matrices of geographical distance and rainfall distance (defined as the difference in mean annual rainfall between sites, and used as a measure of environmental distance). Mantel tests were applied to determine the correlation between species similarity and each type of distance. Factors affecting the decay in species similarity were investigated by comparing different subsets of the data using randomization tests. Results Both rainfall distance and geographical distance had negative effects on species similarity. The effect of rainfall distance was statistically significant even after controlling for differences in geographical distance, and vice versa. The per-unit effect of rainfall distance on species similarity decreased with increasing geographical distance, indicating that the two types of distances interacted in determining the similarity in species composition. Snails showed a higher rate of decay in species similarity with geographical distance than birds, and large snails showed a higher rate of decay than small snails, which are better passive dispersers. The per-unit effects of both rainfall distance and geographical distance on species similarity were higher in the desert region than in the Mediterranean region. Analyses focusing on a grain size of 10 x 10 m showed a lower similarity in species composition and a lower rate of decay in species similarity with rainfall distance than analyses carried out at a grain size of 1 x 1 km. Main conclusions Patterns of similarity in species composition are influenced by the combined effects of environmental variation, the position of the area along environmental gradients, the dispersal properties of the component species, and the scale (both spatial extent and grain size) at which the patterns are examined.},

abstract = {Explaining the mechanisms that produce the enormous diversity within and between tropical tree communities is a pressing challenge for plant community ecologists. Mechanistic hypotheses range from niche-based deterministic to dispersal-based stochastic models. Strong tests of these hypotheses require detailed information regarding the functional strategies of species. A few tropical studies to date have examined trait dispersion within individual forest plots using species trait means in order to ask whether coexisting species tend to be more or less functionally similar than expected given a null model. The present work takes an alternative approach by: (i) explicitly incorporating population-level trait variability; and (ii) quantifying the functional beta diversity in a series of 15 tropical forest plots arrayed along an elevational gradient. The results show a strong pattern of decay in community functional similarity with elevation. These observed patterns of functional beta diversity are shown to be highly non-random and support a deterministic model of tropical tree community assembly and turnover.},

abstract = {The ability of plants to sense their environment gives them the capacity to respond to it plastically. Plastic responses, in turn, frequently alter the environment that plants experience. Plants can modify the environment they experience through many mechanisms—some approximate but others quite precise. The ability of plants to modify the environment they experience can strongly influence the evolution of characters expressed sub- sequently. A review of some theoretical models of habitat selection and of the coevolution of characters and their environments highlights the importance of habitat selection in plants. Novel evolutionary trajectories and outcomes result when organisms are capable of modifying the environment they experience. Specifically, characters can evolve even if they have no genetic variation, and plasticity in environment-determining char- acters may promote specialization in others. Divergence and reproductive isolation may even be augmented by habitat-selecting behavior in plants. An understanding of basic character evolution and the evolution of plasticity in plants requires an appreciation of the ability of plants to modify the environment they experience.},

abstract = {A classic community assembly hypothesis is that all guilds must be represented before additional species from any given guild enter the community. We conceptually extend this hypothesis to continuous functional traits, refine the hypothesis with an eco-evolutionary model of interaction network community assembly, and compare the resultant continuous trait assembly rule to empirical data. Our extension of the “guild assembly rule” to continuous functional traits was rejected, in part, because the eco-evolutionary model predicted trait assembly to be characterized by the expansion of trait space and trait/species sorting within trait space. Hence, the guild rule may not be broadly applicable. A “revised” assembly rule did, however, emerge from the eco-evolutionary model: as communities assemble, the range in trait values will increase to a maximum and then remain relatively constant irrespective of further changes in species richness. This rule makes the corollary prediction that the trait range will, on average, be a saturating function of species richness. To determine if the assembly rule is at work in natural communities, we compared this corollary prediction to empirical data. Consistent with our assembly rule, trait “space” (broadly defined) commonly saturates with species richness. Our assembly rule may thus represent a general constraint placed on community assembly. In addition, taxonomic scale similarly influences the predicted and empirically observed relationship between trait “space” and richness. Empirical support for the model's predictions suggests that studying continuous functional traits in the context of eco-evolutionary models is a powerful approach for elucidating general processes of community assembly.},

abstract = {The phylogenetic relationships of Clethra were investigated by cladistic analyses of DNA sequences from the plastid region trnL-F and the nuclear region ITS. In accordance with the current taxonomy of the genus, section Clethra and section Cuellaria constitute two separate monophyletic groups, but the species Clethra arborea is to be moved to section Clethra from its former position in the monotypic subsection Pseudocuellaria of section Cuellaria. No support for any of the four series within subsection Cuellaria ( section Cuellaria) was obtained. Most of the few morphological characters used as a basis for the current classification are homoplasious when optimized on the molecular phylogeny. An extended data set including various representatives of the ericoid clade was analyzed in order to test whether the choice of outgroup would influence the results, but no variation in the general topology of the tree was observed. The same analysis was used to explore the basal branching of the ericoid clade obtained from an earlier published analysis of sequences from the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes. The combined tree does not contradict the general topology, but whereas our plastid sequence data fully support the earlier proposed phylogenetic relationships within the clade, the basal nodes remain unresolved in the nuclear phylogeny. Our results indicate multiple biogeographic events responsible for Clethra's eastern North American - eastern Asian distribution.},

abstract = {The neotropical Atlantic Forest supports one of the highest degrees of species richness and rates of endemism on the planet, but has also undergone a huge forest loss. However, there exists no broad-scale information about the spatial distribution of its remnants that could guide conservation actions, especially when systematic biodiversity data are not available. In this context, our objectives were to quantify how much of the forest still remains, and analyze its spatial distribution. We considered the entire Brazilian Atlantic Forest, and eight sub-regions, defined according to species distribution. The results revealed a serious situation: more than 80{\%} of the fragments are {\textless}50 ha, almost half the remaining forest is {\textless}100 m from its edges, the average distance between fragments is large (1440 m), and nature reserves protect only 9{\%} of the remaining forest and 1{\%} of the original forest. On the other hand, our estimates of existing Atlantic Forest cover were higher than previous ones (7-8{\%}), ranging from 11.4{\%} to 16{\%}. The differences among estimates are mainly related to our inclusion of intermediate secondary forests and small fragments ({\textless}100 ha), which correspond to approximately 32-40{\%} of what remains. We suggest some guidelines for conservation: (i) large mature forest fragments should be a conservation priority; (ii) smaller fragments can be managed in order to maintain functionally linked mosaics; (iii) the matrix surrounding fragments should be managed so as to minimize edge effects and improve connectivity; and (iv) restoration actions should be taken, particularly in certain key areas. The clear differences in the amount remaining and its spatial distribution within each sub-region must be considered when planning for biodiversity conservation. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Estimates of species divergence times using DNA sequence data are playing an increasingly important role in studies of evolution, ecology and biogeography. Most work has centred on obtaining appropriate kinds of data and developing optimal estimation procedures, whereas somewhat less attention has focused on the calibration of divergences using fossils. Case studies with multiple fossil calibration points provide important opportunities to examine the divergence time estimation problem in new ways. We discuss two cross-validation procedures that address different aspects of inference in divergence time estimation. 'Fossil cross-validation' is a procedure used to identify the impact of different individual calibrations on overall estimation. This can identify fossils that have an exceptionally large error effect and may warrant further scrutiny. 'Fossil-based model cross-validation' is an entirely different procedure that uses fossils to identify the optimal model of molecular evolution in the context of rate smoothing or other inference methods. Both procedures were applied to two recent studies: an analysis of monocot angiosperms with eight fossil calibrations and an analysis of placental mammals with nine fossil calibrations. In each case, fossil calibrations could be ranked from most to least influential, and in one of the two studies, the fossils provided decisive evidence about the optimal molecular evolutionary model.},

At the landscape scale (similar to 1000 ha), communities were phylogenetically clustered. At the local scale (0.375ha), phylogenetic community structure varied among plots. As hypothesized, plots encompassing the greatest environmental variation in light availability exhibited the strongest phylogenetic clustering. We also found strong correlations between species functional traits, particularly specific leaf area (SLA) and perimeter per area (PA), and species light availability niche. There was also a phylogenetic signal in both functional traits and species light availability niche, providing a mechanistic explanation for phylogenetic clustering in relation to light availability. We conclude that the pattern of increased phylogenetic clustering with increased environmental variation is a consequence of environmental filtering acting on phylogenetically conserved functional traits. These results indicate that the importance of environmental filtering in community assembly depends not on spatial scale per se, but on the steepness of the environmental gradient.},

Understanding their joint operation requires extensive information on species characteristics and individual performance. We evaluated first-year survival of 35719 tropical forest seedlings of 222 species and 15 annual cohorts relative to the density of conspecific and heterospecific neighbors and the phylogenetic similarity of heterospecific neighbors. Neighbors were from two size classes, and size asymmetric interactions provided insight into likely mechanisms. Large heterospecific and conspecific neighbors reduced seedling survival equally, suggesting resource competition rather than host-specific enemies as a mechanism. In contrast, much stronger negative conspecific effects were associated with seedling neighbors capable of limited resource uptake, suggesting shared pests rather than competition as the mechanism. Survival improved, however, near phylogenetically similar heterospecific neighbors, suggesting habitat associations shared among closely related species affect spatial patterns of performance. Improved performance near phylogenetically similar neighbors is an emerging pattern in the handful of similar studies.},

abstract = {Bryophyte and vascular plant fossils occur at many late Tertiary sites in Alaska and northern Canada. A number of these floras are received here. The oldest flora, possibly of late Early Miocene age, is probably the one from the Mary Sachs gravel at Duck Hawk Bluffs, Banks Island. The youngest are of early Quaternary age. The floras are of several types. The youngest (Cape Deceit Formation) contains only plants that grow in the Arctic and Subarctic today. The Meighen Island Beaufort Formation contains a few extinct taxa ( Aracites globosa ) and fossil plants, such as Sambucus , Comptonia , and Physocarpus , that are not found in the present subarctic and arctic regions of North America. Some of these floras also contain fossils of a five-needle pine that may represent the Japanese Stone pine ( Pinus pumila ). A third group of floras, from Cone Bluff and Lava Camp, Alaska, usually contains more extinct plants ( Epipremnum crassum , Decodon and cf. Paliurus ) as well as fossils of pines in the subsection Cembrae. The Mary Sachs gravel flora, with taxa such as Metasequoia , Glyptostrobus , Taxodium , Juglans , and Liriodendron , stands apart from all three of the above-mentioned floral types. The Mary Sachs gravel flora represents mixed coniferous and hardwood forests. Most of the other floras represent coniferous forests that were floristically richer than present boreal forest. Some of the richness is due to taxa now found only in Eurasia. The Meighen Island Beaufort flora and some of those from the high-level alluvium on Ellesmere Island represent forest tundra. Several lines of evidence show that the Beaufort Formation on Meighen Island in the Canadian Arctic is about 3 million years old. Several of the younger floras contain abundant, well-preserved bryophyte fossils. Unlike the vascular plants, all of them represent extant species.

abstract = {1. Despite recent advances in understanding community ecology of ectomycorrhizal fungi, little is known about their spatial patterning and the underlying mechanisms driving these patterns across different ecosystems.|2. This meta-study aimed to elucidate the scale, rate and causes of spatial structure of ectomycorrhizal fungal communities in different ecosystems by analysing 16 and 55 sites at the local and global scales, respectively. We examined the distance decay of similarity relationship in species- and phylogenetic lineage-based communities in relation to sampling and environmental variables.|3. Tropical ectomycorrhizal fungal communities exhibited stronger distance-decay patterns compared to non-tropical communities. Distance from the equator and sampling area were the main determinants of the extent of distance decay in fungal communities. The rate of distance decay was negatively related to host density at the local scale. At the global scale, lineage-level community similarity decayed faster with latitude than with longitude.|4. Synthesis. Spatial processes play a stronger role and over a greater scale in structuring local communities of ectomycorrhizal fungi than previously anticipated, particularly in ecosystems with greater vegetation age and closer to the equator. Greater rate of distance decay occurs in ecosystems with lower host density that may stem from increasing dispersal and establishment limitation. The relatively strong latitude effect on distance decay of lineage-level community similarity suggests that climate affects large-scale spatial processes and may cause phylogenetic clustering of ectomycorrhizal fungi at the global scale.},

Eleven of 13 Gleditsia species were sampled, along with two species of its sister genus, Gymnocladus. Analyses of ITS data and of a combined data set that included sequences of ITS and two chloroplast genes supported several conclusions that were interpreted in light of fossil data and current legume phylogeny. Gleditsia and Gymnocladus appear to have originated in eastern Asia during the Eocene. Eastern North American species of both genera most likely evolved from ancestors that migrated across the Bering land bridge, but the eastern Asian/eastern North American disjunction appears to be much older in Gymnocladus than in Gleditsia. Gleditsia amorphoides, from temperate South America, is sister to the rest of the genus, suggesting early long-distance dispersal from Asia. The remainder of Gleditsia is divided into three unresolved clades, possibly indicating a split early in the evolution of the genus. Two of those clades contain only Asian species, and one contains Asian and North American species. The North American species, Gleditsia triacanthos and Gleditsia aquatica, are polymorphic and paraphyletic with respect to their ITS and cpDNA sequences, which suggests recent diversification.},

Such inferences will increasingly benefit from phylogenetic approaches given the ever-accelerating rates of genetic sequencing. In the last few years, models designed to understand diversification from phylogenetic data have advanced significantly. Here, I review these approaches and what they have revealed about diversification in the natural world. I focus on key distinctions between different models, and I clarify the conclusions that can be drawn from each model. I identify promising areas for future research. A major challenge ahead is to develop models that more explicitly take into account ecology, in particular the interaction of species with each other and with their environment. This will not only improve our understanding of diversification; it will also present a new perspective to the use of phylogenies in community ecology, the science of interaction networks and conservation biology, and might shift the current focus in ecology on equilibrium biodiversity theories to non-equilibrium theories recognising the crucial role of history.},

abstract = {Plant-animal mutualistic networks are interaction webs consisting of two sets of entities, plant and animal species, whose evolutionary dynamics are deeply influenced by the outcomes of the interactions, yielding a diverse array of coevolutionary processes. These networks are two-mode networks sharing many common properties with others such as food webs, social, and abiotic networks. Here we describe generalized patterns in the topology of 29 plant-pollinator and 24 plant-frugivore networks in natural communities. Scale-free properties have been described for a number of biological, social, and abiotic networks; in contrast, most of the plant-animal mutualistic networks (65.6{\%}) show species connectivity distributions (number of links per species) with a power-law regime but decaying as a marked cut-off, i.e. truncated power-law or broad-scale networks and few (22.2{\%}) show scale-invariance. We hypothesize that plant-animal mutualistic networks follow a build-up process similar to complex abiotic nets, based on the preferential attachment of species. However, constraints in the addition of links such as morphological mismatching or phenological uncoupling between mutualistic partners, restrict the number of interactions established, causing deviations from scale-invariance. This reveals generalized topological patterns characteristic of self-organized complex systems. Relative to scale-invariant networks, such constraints may confer higher robustness to the loss of keystone species that are the backbone of these webs.},

This relationship, if true, would indicate an additional role for nitrogen in the climate system via its influence on surface albedo and may offer a simple approach for monitoring foliar nitrogen using satellite data. We report, however, that the previously reported correlation is an artifact--it is a consequence of variations in canopy structure, rather than of {\%}N. The data underlying this relationship were collected at sites with varying proportions of foliar nitrogen-poor needleleaf and nitrogen-rich broadleaf species, whose canopy structure differs considerably. When the BRF data are corrected for canopy-structure effects, the residual reflectance variations are negatively related to {\%}N at all wavelengths in the interval 423-855 nm. This suggests that the observed positive correlation between BRF and {\%}N conveys no information about {\%}N. We find that to infer leaf biochemical constituents, e.g., N content, from remotely sensed data, BRF spectra in the interval 710-790 nm provide critical information for correction of structural influences. Our analysis also suggests that surface characteristics of leaves impact remote sensing of its internal constituents. This further decreases the ability to remotely sense canopy foliar nitrogen. Finally, the analysis presented here is generic to the problem of remote sensing of leaf-tissue constituents and is therefore not a specific critique of articles espousing remote sensing of foliar {\%}N.},

abstract = {Chloroplast genomes of Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco] and radiata (Monterey) pine [Pinus radiata D. Don], two conifers from the widespread Pinaceae, were mapped and their genomes were compared to other land plants. Douglas-fir and radiata pine lack the large (20-25 kilobases) inverted repeat that characterizes most land plants. To our knowledge, this is only the second recorded loss of this ancient and highly conserved inverted repeat among all lineages of land plants thus far examined. Loss of the repeat largely accounts for the small size of the conifer genome, 120 kilobase, versus 140-160 kilobases in most land plants. Douglas-fir possesses a major inversion of 40-50 kilobases relative to radiata pine and nonconiferous plants. Nucleotide sequence differentiation between Douglas-fir and radiata pine was estimated to be 3.8{\%}. Both conifer genomes possess a number of rearrangements relative to Osmunda, a fern, Ginkgo, a gymnosperm, and Petunia, an angiosperm. Among land plants, structural changes of this degree have occurred primarily within tribes of the legume family (Fabaceae) that have also lost the inverted repeat. These results support the hypothesis that the presence of the large inverted repeat stabilizes the chloroplast genome against major structural rearrangements.},

@article{Schaal2000,
abstract = {Early in the development of plant evolutionary biology, genetic drift, fluctuations in population size, and isolation were identified as critical processes that affect the course of evolution in plant species. Attempts to assess these processes in natural populations became possible only with the development of neutral genetic markers in the 1960s. More recently, the application of historically ordered neutral molecular variation (within the conceptual framework of coalescent theory) has allowed a reevaluation of these microevolutionary processes. Gene genealogies trace the evolutionary relationships among haplotypes (alleles) with populations. Processes such as selection, fluctuation in population size, and population substructuring affect the geographical and genealogical relationships among these alleles. Therefore, examination of these genealogical data can provide insights into the evolutionary history of a species. For example, studies of Arabidopsis thaliana have suggested that this species underwent rapid expansion, with populations showing little genetic differentiation. The new discipline of phylogeography examines the distribution of allele genealogies in an explicit geographical context. Phylogeographic studies of plants have documented the recolonization of European tree species from refugia subsequent to Pleistocene glaciation, and such studies have been instructive in understanding the origin and domestication of the crop cassava. Currently, several technical limitations hinder the widespread application of a genealogical approach to plant evolutionary studies. However, as these technical issues are solved, a genealogical approach holds great promise for understanding these previously elusive processes in plant evolution.},

The objective of the present study is to analyse the mitochondrial genetic variation of Xiphorhynchus fuscus (Aves: Dendrocolaptidae) from the southern Atlantic forest in Brazil and Argentina, and to discuss whether the results support different hypotheses regarding the local intraspecific diversification of this species. We sequenced 575 bp of the control region of 114 specimens collected in the Brazilian states of Bahia, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, S{\~{a}}o Paulo, Paran{\'{a}}, and Santa Catarina, and in the province of Misiones in Argentina. We studied the population genetic structure with analysis of molecular variance and the demographic history with multiple regression analysis, coalescence simulations, and demographic tests. Xiphorhynchus fuscus presented a significant population genetic structure ($\Phi$st=0.57). Three mitochondrial lineages were described, one associated withXiphorhynchus fuscustenuirostrisand the others withXiphorhynchus fuscus fuscus.The data did not support the primary influence of geographicalbarriers or rivers in the intraspecific diversification ofX. fuscusin the southern Atlantic forest. Instead,the data supported the influence of isolation by geographical distance, recent vicariance events, and demographicexpansions apparently related to Pleistocene and Holocene forest dynamics},

abstract = {Acosmium Schott is a Neotropical genus of ca. 17 species of trees with non-papilionoid, actinomorphic flowers. It has been included in the genistoid clade (Leguminosae, Papilionoideae) in recent phylogenetic analyses. A morphology-based cladistic analysis was performed to test the currently assumed monophyly of Acosmium, assess the validity of the infrageneric classification of Yakovlev, and detect synapomorphies and other diagnostic characters in Acosmium and related taxa. Thirty-four species representing ten genera of subfamily Papilionoideae were included in the analysis: all accepted species of the four sections of Acosmium together with species of Bowdichia, Clathrotropis, Diplotropis, Bolusanthus, Cadia, Poecilanthe, Cyclolobium, and Ormosia; two species of Luetzelburgia were selected as outgroups. The results do not support the monophyly of Acosmium; the species of this genus fall into three distinct, not closely related clades that correspond to the sections of Acosmium established by Yakovlev except for sect. Mesitis that merges into sect. Leptolobium. We propose: (1) recognizing a narrowly circumscribed genus Acosmium; (2) reinstating the generic name Leptolobium Vogel, encompassing sections Leptolobium and Mesitis; and (3) segregating A. praeclarum (Sandwith) Yakovlev into a new genus, Guianodendron. The phylogenetic relevance of some new or neglected characters, especially from bud architecture, seed, and seedling morphology is emphasized.},

abstract = {Invasive species are believed to spread through a process of stratified dispersal consisting of short-distance diffusive spread around established foci and human mediated long-distance jumps. Brazilian peppertree (Schinus terebinthifolius), native to South America, was introduced twice as an ornamental plant into Florida, USA, just over 100 years ago. A previous study indicated that these two introductions were from genetically differentiated source populations in the native range. In this study, we took advantage of these contrasting genetic signatures to study the spatial spread of Brazilian peppertree across its entire range in Florida. A combination of spatial genetic and geostatistical analyses using chloroplast and nuclear microsatellite markers revealed evidence for both diffusive dispersal and long-distance jumps. Chloroplast DNA haplotype distributions and extensive bands of intra-specific hybridization revealed extensive dispersal by both introduced populations across the state. The strong genetic signature around the original introduction points, the presence of a general southeast to northwest genetic cline, and evidence for short-distance genetic spatial autocorrelation provided evidence of diffusive dispersal from an advancing front, probably by birds and small mammals. In the northernmost part of the range, there were patches having a high degree of ancestry from each introduction, suggesting long-distance jump dispersal, probably by the movement of humans. The evidence for extensive movement throughout the state suggests that Brazilian peppertree will be capable of rapidly recolonizing areas from which it has been eradicated. Concerted eradication efforts over large areas or the successful establishment of effective biocontrol agents over a wide area will be needed to suppress this species.},

Molecular phylogenies and new analytical methods provide additional tools to help interpret evolutionary processes. Evolutionary rates in lineages sometimes appear punctuated, and such "explosive" radiations are commonly interpreted as adaptive, leading to causative key innovations being sought. Here we argue that an alternative process might explain apparently rapid radiations ("broom-and-handle" or "stemmy" patterns seen in many phylogenies) with no need to invoke dramatic increase in the rate of diversification. We use simulations to show that mass extinction events can produce the same phylogenetic pattern as that currently being interpreted as due to an adaptive radiation. By comparing simulated and empirical phylogenies of Australian and southern African legumes, we find evidence for coincident mass extinctions in multiple lineages that could have resulted from global climate change at the end of the Eocene.},

abstract = {Global patterns in species richness have resisted explanation since they first caught the attention of ecologists in the 1960s. The failure of ecology to fully integrate the diversity issue into its core of accepted wisdom derives from an inappropriate concept of community and the rejection of history and region as formative contexts for ecological systems. Traditionally, ecologists have held that the pervasive relationship between species richness and conditions of the physical environment reflects the influence of environment on the ability of populations to coexist locally. However, many ecologists now recognize that this relationship can also develop historically from the evolutionary diversification of lineages within and between ecological zones. To assess the relative roles of local ecological constraint vs. regional and historical unfolding of diversity-environment relationships, we must abandon localized concepts of the community and adopt historical (particularly phylogenetic) and geographic methods to evaluate the evolution of diversity within large regions and its influence on diversity at local scales. This integrated perspective opens new research directions for ecologists to explore the formation of species, adaptive diversification, and the adjustment of ecological distributions of species on regional scales.},

abstract = {Although the chloroplast genome contains many noncoding regions, relatively few have been exploited for interspecific phylogenetic and intraspecific phylogeographic studies. In our recent evaluation of the phylogenetic utility of 21 noncoding chloroplast regions, we found the most widely used noncoding regions are among the least variable, but the more variable regions have rarely been employed. That study led us to conclude that there may be unexplored regions of the chloroplast genome that have even higher relative levels of variability. To explore the potential variability of previously unexplored regions, we compared three pairs of single-copy chloroplast genome sequences in three disparate angiosperm lineages: Atropa vs. Nicotiana (asterids); Lotus vs. Medicago (rosids); and Saccharum vs. Oryza (monocots). These three separate sequence alignments highlighted 13 mutational hotspots that may be more variable than the best regions of our former study. These 13 regions were then selected for a more detailed analysis. Here we show that nine of these newly explored regions (rpl32-trnL((UAG)), trnQ((UUG))-5'rps16, 3'trnV((UAC))-ndhC, ndhF-rpl32, psbD-trnT((GGU)), psbJ-petA, 3'rps16-5'trnK((UUU)), atpI-atpH, and petL-psbE) offer levels of variation better than the best regions identified in our earlier study and are therefore likely to be the best choices for molecular studies at low taxonomic levels.},

However, multiple alternate classifications exist in which the number of functional groups, the number of species per functional group, and the grouping of species differ from the a priori scheme. Without assessing the relative precision, or ability of an a priori scheme to accurately predict ecosystem functioning relative to its many alternatives, the validity and utility of analyses based on a single a priori classification scheme remains unclear. We examine the precision of a priori classifications used in 10 experimental grassland systems in Europe and the United States that have found evidence for a significant role of functional plant diversity in governing ecosystem function. The predictive precision of the a priori classifications employed in these studies was seldom significantly higher than the precision of random classifications. Post-hoc classification schemes that performed well in predicting ecosystem function resembled each other more with regard to species composition than average classifications, but there was still considerable variability in the manner in which these classification schemes grouped species. These results suggest that we need a more nuanced understanding of how the diversity of functional traits of species in an assemblage affects ecosystem functioning.},

We have extended this framework by decomposing growth rates of ∼130 000 trees of 171 Neotropical tree species into intrinsic growth and the response of growth to light and size. We related these growth characteristics to multiple functional traits (wood density, adult stature, seed mass, leaf traits) in a hierarchical Bayesian model that accounted for measurement error and intraspecific variability of functional traits. Wood density was the most important trait determining all three growth characteristics. Intrinsic growth rates were additionally strongly related to adult stature, while all traits contributed to light response. Our analysis yielded a predictive model that allows estimation of growth characteristics for rare species on the basis of a few easily measurable morphological traits.},

This understanding is crucial, not only for improving ecological knowledge, but also for managing properly the genetic diversity of threatened and endangered populations. For nearly 80 years, population geneticists have investigated how physiognomy and other landscape features have influenced genetic variation within and between populations. They have relied on sampling populations that have been identified beforehand because most population genetics methods have required discrete populations. However, a new approach has emerged for analyzing spatial genetic data without requiring that discrete populations be identified in advance. This approach, landscape genetics, promises to facilitate our understanding of how geographical and environmental features structure genetic variation at both the population and individual levels, and has implications for ecology, evolution and conservation biology. It differs from other genetic approaches, such as phylogeography, in that it tends to focus on processes at finer spatial and temporal scales.

abstract = {The papilionoid legume genus Glycine Willd. consists of 24 named species (Hymowitz, 2004) with perhaps as many as nine additional species yet to be described (Pfeil unpublished data). These include G. max (L.) Merr., a model taxon and the economically important cultivated soybean. The genus Glycine is thought to be of ancient polyploid origin due to the high chromosome number of the majority of species (n = 20) compared to closely related genera (mostly n = 10 or 11, one with n = 14; Goldblatt, 1981). Additional lines of evidence exist supporting this hypothesis of polyploid origin including cytogenetic studies in haploid G. max (Crane et al., 1982), the presence of twice as many gene copies encoding leghemoglobin in Glycine as in Phaseolus vulgaris L. (n = 11; Lee and Verma, 1984), the increased ability of G. max gametophytes to tolerate the presence of extra chromosomes (Xu et al., 2000b), and the reduction in harmful effects observed in G. max monosomics (Xu et al., 2000a). Linkage mapping studies of G. max have also identified large regions of duplication, a finding consistent with an ancient polyploidy event (Shoemaker et al., 1996; Zhu et al., 1994). Glycine also includes the neopolyploids G. tomentella Hayata, G. tabacina (Labill.) Benth., G. pescadrensis Hayata, and G. hirticaulis Tindale and Craven, which all have one or more polyploid cytotypes (2n = 78 and/or 80 for each species; reviewed in Doyle et al., 2004). Although strong evidence for an ancient genome duplication in Glycine exists, the nature of that polyploidy event is still not clear (Doyle et al., 2003; Hymowitz, 2004). Kumar and Hymowitz (1989) discussed the possibility that the genus may be of allotetraploid origin, especially given evidence for other allopolyploids within the Glycininae. Singh et al. (2001) found duplicated rDNA loci in the C-genome species (G. curvata Tindale and G. cyrtoloba Tindale) relative to the number in other diploids and interpreted this as evidence that "strongly" supports a hypothesis of allotetraploid origin for the genus. Glycine species described at the time of that study exhibit diploid-like meiotic pairing (Singh et al., 2001), another observation that is expected in allopolyploids. However, diploidization during the time since an ancient autopolyploidy event could produce the same pattern of chromosome pairing. Doyle et al. (2003) found that the gene encoding chloroplast-expressed glutamine synthetase (ncpGS) was present in duplicate copy in Glycine but single copy in most other Glycininae sampled. However, the phylogeny based on this gene's DNA sequence placed the Glycine paralogues sister to one another, and thereby found no evidence to support allopolyploidy (Doyle et al., 2003). Both of these approaches have limitations. Finding duplicated rDNA loci does not test auto- versus allopolyploid hypotheses. Additionally, the presence of this duplication in one clade alone could readily be explained by lineage-specific duplication and not by polyploidy. Diploidization during the 14.5 MY (million years) or so since polyploidy (Schlueter et al., 2004) could also render the meiotic pairing observations null, because there has been much time within which multivalent formation could change to bivalent formation if the event was of an autopolyploid nature. The phylogenetic analysis of a duplicated nuclear gene (chloroplast-expressed glutamine synthetase; ncpGS) used by Doyle et al. (2003) is more promising in that this approach has some power to discriminate among the hypotheses for duplicated loci, especially in being able to exclude autopolyploidy if one Glycine gene copy is more closely related to a copy from another taxon (Fig. 1A). However, the phylogenetic approach is also limited by the inability to distinguish among autopolyploidy, independent gene duplication subsequent to divergence of Glycine from other genera, or failure to sample the genome donors that formed an allopolyploid Glycine (perhaps due to their extinction) (Fig. 1). If additional unlinked nuclear genes are used, the convergence of many of these on the same topology makes it possible to exclude independent gene duplications, but still does not distinguish between autopolyploidy and allopolyploidy where the latter has occurred with extinction or failure to sample the genome contributors. Approaches that have used multiple genes to examine polyploidy in Glycine include the analysis of synonymous substitution levels in large numbers of G. max expressed sequence tag (EST) paralogue pairs (Schlueter et al., 2004). That study showed that the Glycine genome has gone through two major rounds of duplication, one estimated at 41.6 MY ago and another at 14.5 MY ago. The more recent event is presumably shared by all species of Glycine, and thus relates to the increase in chromosome number, whereas the earlier event is shared by over 7000 species of legumes (Pfeil et al., 2005). Blanc and Wolfe (2004) in a similar study to Schlueter et al. (2004) also detected two rounds of duplication in soybean, although the estimated ages for these events are quite different due to different rate calibrations. Schlueter et al. (2004) identified the signature of two polyploid events (or large scale gene duplications) by examining the distribution of Ks values among 275 gene pairs within the G. max genome. A maximum likelihood approach fitted two normal distributions with optimum likelihood to the overall Ks distribution, indicating that two separate large-scale gene duplication events could best explain the Ks distribution, rather than one, or three or more events. Gene pairs around the mode of the younger (ca. 14.5 MY) duplication event are ideal candidates for examining the nature of this event. We focus here on addressing the question of whether Glycine was formed through an autopolyploidy or allopolyploidy event by determining the nature of the 14.5 MYA duplication event. In a novel approach to this type of problem, we selected a low-copy nuclear gene for phylogenetic analysis whose paralogues differ by a Ks value that is consistent with duplication during the 14.5 MY ago genome event found by Schlueter et al. (2004). The topological outcomes expected under each hypothesis (Fig. 1) should allow us to determine whether this gene and ncpGS agree, which would bolster support for our previous conclusion (Doyle et al., 2003) that there is no evidence for an allopolyploid origin of Glycine. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {We have developed a pruning algorithm for likelihood estimation of a tree of populations. This algorithm enables us to compute the likelihood for large trees. Thus, it gives an efficient way of obtaining the MLE for a given tree topology. Our method utilizes the differences accumulated by random genetic drift in allele count data from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), ignoring the effect of mutation after divergence from the common ancestral population. The computation of the maximum likelihood tree involves both maximizing likelihood over branch lengths of a given topology and comparing the maximum likelihood across topologies. Here our focus is the maximization of likelihood over branch lengths of a given topology. The pruning algorithm computes arrays of probabilities at the root of the tree from the data at the tips of the tree; at the root, the arrays determine the likelihood. The arrays consist of probabilities related to the number of coalescences and allele counts for the partially coalesced lineages. Computing these probabilities requires an unusual two-stage algorithm. Our computation is exact, and avoids time consuming Monte Carlo methods. We can also correct for ascertainment bias.},

We review recent advances in detecting plant pigments at the leaf level and discuss successes and reasons why challenges remain for robust remote observation and quantification.

abstract = {1. Niche theory proposes that species differences underlie both coexistence within communities and the differentiation in species composition among communities via limiting similarity and environmental filtering. However, it has been difficult to extend niche theory to species-rich communities because of the empirical challenge of quantifying niches for many species. This has motivated the development of functional and phylogeny-based approaches in community ecology, which represent two different means of approximating niche attributes. 2. Here, we assess the utility of plant functional traits and phylogenetic relationships in predicting community assembly processes using the largest trait and phylogenetic data base to date for any set of species-rich communities. 3. We measured 17 functional traits for all 4672 individuals of 668 tree species co-occurring in nine tropical rain forest plots in French Guiana. Trait variation was summarized into two ordination axes that reflect species niche overlap. 4. We also generated a dated molecular phylogenetic tree based onDNA sequencing of two plastid loci (rbcL and matK) comprising 97{\%}of the individuals and 91{\%}of the species in the plots. 5. We found that, on average, co-occurring species had greater functional and, to a lesser extent, phylogenetic similarity than expected by chance. 6. We also found that functional traits and their ordination loadings showed significant, albeit weak, phylogenetic signal, suggesting that phylogenetic distance provides pertinent information on niche overlap in tropical tree communities. 7. Synthesis. We provide the most comprehensive examination to date of the relative importance of environmental filtering and limiting similarity in structuring tropical tree communities. Our results confirm that environmental filtering is the overriding influence on community assembly in these species-rich systems.},

abstract = {This paper presents the first molecular phylogeny of the genus Passiflora encompassing almost all sections of this large genus. The nuclear-encoded chloroplast-expressed glutamine synthetase gene (ncpGS) was used to examine the relationships among Passiflora species (passionflowers), which was then compared with the new classification proposed by Feuillet and MacDougal. The resulting Bayesian, likelihood, and parsimony trees are congruent and well supported. The 90 Passiflora species examined apparently split into eight main subgenera: Plectostemma, Granadilla, Astrophea, Deidamioides, Polyanthea, Dysosmia, Tetrapathea, and Tryphostemmatoides. These results are in overall agreement with the Feuillet and MacDougal's classification but here we propose that three additional subgenera, Polyanthea, Dysosmia, and Tetrapathea, should be maintained. We observe a striking overall correlation between the phylogenetic position of the different species and their chromosome number. The first clade contains the arborescent species of the subgenus Astrophea, with n = 12. The second clade, subgenus Plectostemma, includes species from four subgenera of Killip's classification with n = 6 chromosomes. The last clade, subgenus Granadilla, includes species of seven old subgenera with n = 9. Subgenus Dysosmia, with a variable chromosome number of n = 9-11, is considered here as a separate subgenus closely related to the subgenus Granadilla. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Diatoms are the dominant group of phytoplankton in the modern ocean. They account for approximately 40{\%} of oceanic primary productivity and over 50{\%} of organic carbon burial in marine sediments. Owing to their role as a biological carbon pump and effects on atmospheric CO(2) levels, there is great interest in elucidating factors that influenced the rapid rise in diatom diversity during the past 40 million years. Two biotic controls on diversification have been proposed to explain this diversity increase: (1) geochemical coupling between terrestrial grasslands and marine ecosystems through the global silicon cycle; and (2) competitive displacement of other phytoplankton lineages. However, these hypotheses have not been tested using sampling-standardized fossil data. Here we show that reconstructions of species diversity in marine phytoplankton reject these proposed controls and suggest a new pattern for oceanic diatom diversity across the Cenozoic. Peak species diversity in marine planktonic diatoms occurred at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary and was followed by a pronounced decline, from which diversity has not recovered. Although the roles of abiotic and biotic drivers of diversification remain unclear, major features of oceanic diatom evolution are decoupled from both grassland expansion and competition among phytoplankton groups.},

abstract = {1. Analyzing the phylogenetic structure of natural communities may illuminate the processes gov-erning the assembly and coexistence of species. For instance, an association between species co-occurrence in local communities and their phylogenetic proximity may reveal the action of habitat filtering, niche conservatism and/or competitive exclusion. 2. Different methods were recently proposed to test such community-wide phylogenetic patterns, based on the phylogenetic clustering or overdispersion of the species in a local community. This pro-vides a much needed framework for addressing long standing questions in community ecology as well as the recent debate on community neutrality. The testing procedures are based on (i) a metric measuring the association between phylogenetic distance and species co-occurrence, and (ii) a data set randomization algorithm providing the distribution of the metric under a given 'null model'. However, the statistical properties of these approaches are not well-established and their reliability must be tested against simulated data sets. 3. This paper reviews metrics and null models used in previous studies. A 'locally neutral' subdi-vided community model is simulated to produce data sets devoid of phylogenetic structure in the spatial distribution of species. Using these data sets, the consistency of Type I error rates of tests based on 10 metrics combined with nine null models is examined. 4. This study shows that most tests can become liberal (i.e. tests rejecting too often the null hypoth-esis that only neutral processes structured spatially the local community) when the randomization algorithm breaks down a structure in the original data set unrelated to the null hypothesis to test. Hence, when overall species abundances are distributed non-randomly across the phylogeny or when local abundances are spatially autocorrelated, better statistical performances were achieved by randomization algorithms preserving these structural features. The most reliable randomization algorithm consists of permuting species with similar abundances among the tips of the phylogenetic tree. One metric, R PD-DO , also proved to be robust under most simulated conditions using a variety of null models. 5. Synthesis . Given the suboptimal performances of several tests, attention must be paid to the test-ing procedures used in future studies. Guidelines are provided to help choosing an adequate test.},

abstract = {Abstract: Mechanisms proposed to explain the maintenance of species diversity within ecological communities of sessile organisms include niche differentiation mediated by competitive trade-offs, frequency dependence resulting from species-specific pests, recruitment limitation due to local dispersal, and a speciation-extinction dynamic equilibrium mediated by stochasticity (drift). While each of these processes, and more, have been shown to act in particular communities, much remains to be learned about their relative importance in shaping community-level patterns. We used a spatially-explicit, individual-based model to assess the effects of each of these processes on species richness, relative abundance, and spatial patterns such as the species-area curve. Our model communities had an order-of-magnitude more individuals than any previous such study, and we also developed a finite-size scaling analysis to infer the large-scale properties of these systems in order to establish the generality of our conclusions across system sizes. As expected, each mechanism can promote diversity. We found some qualitative differences in community patterns across communities in which different combinations of these mechanisms operate. Species-area curves follow a power law with short-range dispersal and a logarithmic law with global dispersal. Relative-abundance distributions are more even for systems with competitive differences and trade-offs than for those in which all species are competitively equivalent, and they are most even when frequency dependence (even if weak) is present. Overall, however, communities in which different processes operated showed surprisingly similar patterns, which suggests that the form of community-level patterns cannot in general be used to distinguish among mechanisms maintaining diversity there. Nevertheless, parameterization of models such as these from field data on the strengths of the different mechanisms could yield insight into their relative roles in diversity maintenance in any given community.},

We assessed the degree of correlated evolution among eight traits associated with leaf toughness and the relationships of those traits with the growth and mortality rates of 197 tree and shrub species from the understory of the 50-ha forest dynamics plot on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Path analysis with phylogenetically independent contrasts revealed that leaves attained material toughness (resistance to fracture per unit fracture area) through increases in tissue density, percent cellulose per unit dry mass, and vein fracture toughness. Lamina density and cellulose content evolved independently and thus represent different paths to material toughness. Structural toughness (resistance to fracture per unit fracture length) depended on material toughness and lamina thickness. Mortality rates of individuals 1-10 cm in stem diameter were negatively correlated with material toughness and lamina density but were independent of structural toughness and cell wall fiber contents. Leaf toughness traits were uncorrelated with relative growth rates. Results imply that material toughness enhances resistance to natural enemies, which increases survival and offsets the biomass allocation cost of producing tough leaves in the shaded understory.},

abstract = {We investigated genetic differentiation among populations of the clonal grass Elymus athericus, a common salt-marsh species occurring along the Wadden Sea coast of Europe. While E. athericus traditionally occurs in the high salt marsh, it recently also invaded lower parts of the marsh. In one of the first analyses of the genetic population structure in salt-marsh species, we were interested in population differentiation through isolation-by-distance, and among strongly divergent habitats (low and high marsh) in this wind- and water-dispersed species. High and low marsh habitats were sampled at six sites throughout the Wadden Sea. Based on reciprocal transplantation experiments conducted earlier revealing lower survival of foreign genotypes we predicted reduced gene flow among habitats. Accordingly, an analysis with polymorphic cross-species microsatellite primers revealed significant genetic differentiation between high and low marsh habitats already on a very small scale ({\textless} 100 m), while isolation-by-distance was present only on larger scales (60-443 km). In an analysis of molecular variance we found that 14{\%} of the genetic variance could be explained by the differentiation between habitats, as compared to only 8.9{\%} to geographical (isolation-by-distance) effects among six sites 2.5-443 km distant from each other. This suggests that markedly different selection regimes between these habitats, in particular intraspecific competition and herbivory, result in habitat adaptation and restricted gene flow over distances as small as 80 m. Hence, the genetic population structure of plant species can only be understood when considering geographical and selection-mediated restrictions to gene flow simultaneously.},

abstract = {The Brazilian rosewood (Dalbergia nigra) is an endangered tree endemic to the central Brazilian Atlantic Forest, one of the world's most threatened biomes. The population diversity, phylogeographic structure and demographic history of this species were investigated using the variation in the chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) sequences of 185 individuals from 19 populations along the geographical range of the species. Fifteen haplotypes were detected in the analysis of 1297 bp from two non-coding sequences, trnV-trnM and trnL. We identified a strong genetic structure (F(ST)=0.62, P{\textless}0.0001), with a latitudinal separation into three phylogeographic groups. The two northernmost groups showed evidence of having maintained historically larger populations than the southernmost group. Estimates of divergence times between these groups pointed to vicariance events in the Middle Pleistocene (ca. 350,000-780,000 years ago). The recurrence of past climatic changes in the central part of the Atlantic forest, with cycles of forest expansion and contraction, may have led to repeated vicariance events, resulting in the genetic differentiation of these groups. Based on comparisons among the populations of large reserves and small, disturbed fragments of the same phylogeographic group, we also found evidence of recent anthropogenic effects on genetic diversity. The results were also analysed with the aim of contributing to the conservation of D. nigra. We suggest that the three phylogeographic groups could be considered as three distinct management units. Based on the genetic diversity and uniqueness of the populations, we also indicate priority areas for conservation.},

abstract = {Leaves and fruits of Ulmus from the Early–Middle Eocene of British Columbia and Washington are assigned to two species. Ulmus okanaganensis sp.nov. is based on leaves attached to flowering and fruiting twigs and isolated leaves and fruits. Leaves display a polymorphism ranging from large leaves with compound teeth with a blunt apex to small ones with simple teeth resembling those of Zelkova. In extant Ulmus, sucker-shoot leaves, elongation-shoot leaves, and leaves on short annual branches often display a very similar polymorphism. In the fossil, flowers are arranged in fascicles having short pedicels. Fascicles are formed in the axils of leaves of current-year shoots and appear together with the leaves. This is uncommon in modern species of Ulmus, where leaves appear either in spring on previous-year shoots or in autumn in the axils of leaves of current-year shoots. Fruits of U. okanaganensis are samaras with extremely reduced or absent wings. Unwinged fruits of modern Ulmus are typically ciliate along the margin of the endocarp and the persistent styles but only a single fruit of U. okanaganensis has been found preserving hairs. The small, shallowly lobed perianth is situated below the endocarp. A second type of foliage is assigned to Ulmus chuchuanus (Berry) LaMotte. This foliage is wider than that of U. okanaganensis and has more densely spaced secondary veins. It also has characteristic compound teeth with primary and subsidiary teeth displaying conspicuously different orientations. Leaves of U. chuchuanus co-occur with a second type of fruit but have not been found in attachment. These fruits are larger than in U. okanaganensis, with a narrow wing, persistent styles, and a large and wide persistent perianth that tapers abruptly into the perianth tube. A cladistic analysis suggests that U. okanaganensis is nested within the subgenus Ulmus, which is a paraphyletic grade basal to the subgenus Oreoptelea. Ulmus chuchuanus foliage shows affinities to the subgenus Ulmus, while the associated fruits display affinities to the subgenus Oreoptelea.

abstract = {Gelsemiaceae consist of two intercontinental disjunct genera: Gelsemium (3 species) and Mostuea (9 species). Gelsemium is distributed in eastern Asia and eastern North America, while Mostuea is disjunct between South America and Africa. In this study, sequences of three chloroplast genes (ndhF, rbcL, and matK) and the external transcribed spacer (ETS) of the ribosomal DNA region were used to examine phylogenetic relationships of Gelsemiaceae. Our results support the monophyly of Gelsemiaceae, Mostuea, and Gelsemium; however, more data are needed to resolve relationships of Gelsemiaceae with other families of Gentianales. Within Mostuea, M. surinamensis of South America is sister to the clade containing African species, indicating that it is unlikely that M. surinamensis is an introduced species from Africa since the morphology of the species is also different from all of the African species. North American species of Gelsemium form a clade that is sister to G. elegans of eastern Asia, which is consistent with flower and fruit morphology. Both Mostuea and Gelsemium show the most common phylogenetic patterns of intercontinental disjunct genera: reciprocal monophyly of species on separate continents.

abstract = {Plant geographers have sought for decades to describe and predict the geographic distribution of vegetation types on the basis of plant function and its relationship with the abiotic environment. Traditionally this has been accomplished using categorical representations such as plant functional types. Increasingly, plant functional ecologists have sought to refine categorical functional types via quantitative functional traits in order to understand the ecological implications of trade-offs in plant form and function. Fewer works have focused upon testing whether commonly measured functional traits enhance our understanding of plant biogeography broadly and the geographic distribution of vegetation types in particular. Here we combine a continental-scale forest inventory data set containing 18 111 plots with a plant functional trait data set to ask: (1) Is there a strong relationship between the abiotic environment and the distribution of functional trait values in forest inventory plots? And (2) can different Holdridge life zones be distinguished upon the basis of their functional trait distributions? The results show geographic patterns of functional trait distributions that are often strongly correlated with climate and also show that the Holdridge life zones in the study area can be differentiated using a combination of functional traits.},

Here we refer to these situations as 'relaxed selection,' and review recent studies that explore the effects of such changes on traits in their ecological contexts. In a few systems, such as the loss of armor in stickleback, the genetic, developmental and ecological bases of trait evolution are being discovered. These results yield insights into whether and how fast a trait is reduced or lost under relaxed selection. We provide a prospectus and a framework for understanding relaxed selection and trait loss in natural populations.

abstract = {What allows some species to successfully colonize a novel environment while others fail? Numerous studies in invasion biology have sought to answer this question, but those studies have tended to focus on traits of species or individuals (e.g. body size, seed size, seed number), and these traits have largely been found to be weak predictors of invasion success. However, characteristics of colonizing populations (e.g. genetic diversity, density, age structure) might also be important for successful establishment, as the authors of a study published in this issue of Molecular Ecology show (Crawford {\&} Whitney 2010). By experimentally manipulating the density and genetic diversity of colonizing populations of Arabidopsis thaliana, the authors found that genetic diversity, but not population density, increased colonization success. Importantly, the effects of genetic diversity on colonization success were both additive and non-additive, suggesting that traits associated with particular genotypes and complimentarity among genotypes contribute to colonization success. This research highlights the importance of considering within-species variation and characteristics of entire populations in predicting colonization success.},

First, they control ecosystem processes and define habitat and resources for other taxa; thus, they are a high priority for understanding the ecosystem at a site. Second, knowledge of trait costs and benefits offers the most promising path to understanding how vegetation properties change along physical geography gradients. There exists an informal shortlist of plant traits that are thought to be most informative. Here, we summarize recent research on correlations and tradeoffs surrounding some traits that are prospects for the shortlist. By extending the list and by developing better models for how traits influence species distributions and interactions, a strong foundation of basic ecology can be established, with many practical applications. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast to most previous studies, Celastrales and Malpighiales are resolved as being more closely related to one another than either are to Oxalidales. The Huaceae are well supported as the sister group to Oxalidales, not Celastrales, as had been previously proposed. The Lepidobotryaceae are unambiguously supported as sister to the clade consisting of Celastraceae and Parnassiaceae. The Parnassiaceae are well supported as members of an early branching lineage within Celastraceae, rather than as its sister group. Likewise, Pottingeria appears to be part of an early derived lineage of Celastraceae. Empleuridium is unambiguously supported as a derived member of Celastraceae, as are Brexia, Canotia, Siphonodon, Stackhousia,and Tripterococcus. Bhesa is unambiguously supported as a member of Malpighi- ales, though its relationships within the order remain unclear. Perrottetia should be transferred out of Celastraceae and into eurosids II, being closely related to Tapiscia and Dipentodon.

These records are also widely used as a general climate indicator for comparison with local and more specific marine and terrestrial climate proxy records. We present new benthic foraminiferal {\&}948;18O and {\&}948;13C compilations for individual ocean basins that provide a robust estimate of benthic foraminiferal stable isotopic variations to {\&}8764;80 Ma and tentatively to {\&}8764;110 Ma. First-order variations in interbasinal isotopic gradients delineate transitions from interior ocean heterogeneity during the Late Cretaceous ({\textgreater}{\&}8764;65 Ma) to early Paleogene (35{\&}8211;65 Ma) homogeneity and a return to heterogeneity in the late Paleogene{\&}8211;early Neogene (35{\&}8211;0 Ma). We propose that these transitions reflect alterations in a first-order characteristic of ocean circulation: the ability of winds to make water in the deep ocean circulate. We document the initiation of large interbasinal {\&}948;18O gradients in the early Oligocene and link the variations in interbasinal {\&}948;18O gradients from the middle Eocene to Oligocene with the increasing influence of wind-driven mixing due to the gradual tectonic opening of Southern Ocean passages and initiation and strengthening of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The role of wind-driven upwelling, possibly associated with a Tethyan Circumequatorial Current, in controlling Late Cretaceous interior ocean heterogeneity should be the subject of further research.},

abstract = {Spanish Cedar (Cedrela odorata L.) is a globally important timber species which has been severely exploited in Mesoamerica for over 200 years. Using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphisms, its chloroplast (cp) DNA phylogeography was studied in Mesoamerica with samples from 29 populations in six countries. Five haplotypes were characterized, phylogenetically grouped into three lineages (Northern, Central and Southern). Spatial analysis of ordered genetic distance confirmed deviation from a pattern of isolation by distance. The geographically proximate Northern and Central cpDNA lineages were genetically the most differentiated, with the Southern lineage appearing between them on a minimum spanning tree. However, populations possessing Southern lineage haplotypes occupy distinct moist habitats, in contrast to populations possessing Northern and Central lineage haplotypes which occupy drier and more seasonal habitats. Given the known colonization of the proto-Mesoamerican peninsula by South American flora and fauna prior to the formation of the Isthmus of Panama, it seems most likely that the observed population structure in C. odorata results from repeated colonization of Mesoamerica from South American source populations. Such a model would imply an ancient, pre-Isthmian colonization of a dry-adapted type (possessing the Northern lineage or a prototype thereof), with a secondary colonization via the land bridge. Following this, a more recent (possibly post-Pleistocene) expansion of moist-adapted types possessing the Southern lineage from the south fits the known vegetation history of the region.},

abstract = {Reproductive biology, including phenology, flower biology, pollination, and the reproductive system in the bromeliad Aechmea distichantha were studied in an Araucaria forest in the state of Paran{\'{a}}. Phenology and reproduction in terricolous plants were followed in October 2006 and May - October of 2007. Flowering peaked from June to September and fruiting was from June to October. Flower anthesis lasted one day. Flowers were pollinated the most by the hummingbird Stephanoxis lalandi and the most common butterfly visitor was Lychnuchoides ozias ozias. Nectar concentration declined during anthesis, while nectar volume was constant. Aechmea distichantha is self-compatible with 30-45{\%} fruit formation in self-pollination tests. Sunlight infl uences reproduction: when controlling for bromeliad and infl orescence size, plants in sunlight produced more seeds per fruit than plants in the shade. Reproduction was also associated with inflorescence size when controlling for bromeliad size. That is, larger infl orescences in similar sized plants produced more fl owers and more seeds per fruit.},

abstract = {Some major evolutionary theories predict a relationship between rates of proliferation of new species (species diversification) and rates of morphological divergence between them. However, this relationship has not been rigorously tested using phylogeny-based approaches. Here, we test this relationship with morphological and phylogenetic data from 190 species of plethodontid salamanders. Surprisingly, we find that rates of species diversification and morphological evolution are not significantly correlated, such that rapid diversification can occur with little morphological change, and vice versa. We also find that most clades have undergone remarkably similar patterns of morphological evolution (despite extensive sympatry) and that those relatively novel phenotypes are not associated with rapid diversification. Finally, we find a strong relationship between rates of size and shape evolution, which has not been previously tested.},

abstract = {The Australian fossil record shows that from ca. 25 Myr ago, the aseasonal-wet biome (rainforest and wet heath) gave way to the unique Australian sclerophyll biomes dominated by eucalypts, acacias and casuarinas. This transition coincided with tectonic isolation of Australia, leading to cooler, drier, more seasonal climates. From 3 Myr ago, aridification caused rapid opening of the central Australian arid zone. Molecular phylogenies with dated nodes have provided new perspectives on how these events could have affected the evolution of the Australian flora. During the Mid-Cenozoic (25-10 Myr ago) period of climatic change, there were rapid radiations in sclerophyll taxa, such as Banksia, eucalypts, pea-flowered legumes and Allocasuarina. At the same time, taxa restricted to the aseasonal-wet biome (Nothofagus, Podocarpaceae and Araucariaceae) did not radiate or were depleted by extinction. During the Pliocene aridification, two Eremean biome taxa (Lepidium and Chenopodiaceae) radiated rapidly after dispersing into Australia from overseas. It is clear that the biomes have different histories. Lineages in the aseasonal-wet biome are species poor, with sister taxa that are species rich, either outside Australia or in the sclerophyll biomes. In conjunction with the fossil record, this indicates depletion of the Australian aseasonal-wet biome from the Mid-Cenozoic. In the sclerophyll biomes, there have been multiple exchanges between the southwest and southeast, rather than single large endemic radiations after a vicariance event. There is need for rigorous molecular phylogenetic studies so that additional questions can be addressed, such as how interactions between biomes may have driven the speciation process during radiations. New studies should include the hitherto neglected monsoonal tropics.},

Two hundred two individuals of 9 populations were analysed using three chloroplast and six nuclear microsatellite markers. The observed heterozygosity varied markedly among the populations for nuclear (H(Onuc )= 0.20-0.50) and chloroplast microsatellites (H (cp )= 0.22-0.68). The continental population from French Guyana showed a higher value of H(Onuc) than island populations, and the differences were significant in some cases. The fixation index F (IS) ranged from -0.043 to 0.368; a significant heterozygote deficit was detected in 7 populations. The heterozygosity excess method suggested that two populations in Guadeloupe have undergone a recent bottleneck. Global and pairwise F (ST) were high for both nuclear (F(STnuc )= 0.29) and chloroplast microsatellites (F(STcp )= 0.58). The neighbour-joining tree based on both markers, presented a differentiation pattern that can be explained by the seed dispersal by flotation and marine stream. The comparison of Bayesian approach and the method based on allelic frequency demonstrate a very limited number of migrants between populations.},

abstract = {The demography of populations living in variable environments is an important factor molding the evolution of ecological niches, for it determines the relative strength of selection pressures on adaptations to different habitats. Here I consider a coarse-grained environment consisting of two habitat types and investigate how the selection pressure on reproductive success in different habitats depends on their quality and frequency and the dispersal pattern. The results suggest that selection on adaptations to optimal habitats will usually be stronger than on adaptations to poor habitats and the ecological niche will thus tend to be an evolutionarily conservative character. It is because under the habitat choice or limited dispersal that seem to prevail in natural populations, more individuals encounter the better habitat than would be expected solely on the basis of its relative area. This bias results in reduced selection pressure on reproductive success in the poorer habitat. With habitat choice or limited dispersal, selection pressure on reproductive success in the poorer habitat may exceed that on reproductive success in the better habitat only if the poorer habitat is much more frequent in the environment than the better habitat and the difference in their quality is not large.},

abstract = {Phylogenetic signal is the tendency for closely related species to display similar trait values due to their common ancestry. Several methods have been developed for quantifying phylogenetic signal in univariate traits and for sets of traits treated simultaneously, and the statistical properties of these approaches have been extensively studied. However, methods for assessing phylogenetic signal in high-dimensional multivariate traits like shape are less well developed, and their statistical performance is not well characterized. In this article, I describe a generalization of the K statistic of Blomberg et al. (2003) that is useful for quantifying and evaluating phylogenetic signal in highly-dimensional multivariate data. The method (Kmult) is found from the equivalency between statistical methods based on covariance matrices and those based on distance matrices. Using computer simulations based on Brownian motion, I demonstrate that the expected value of Kmult remains at 1.0 as trait variation among species is increased or decreased, and as the number of trait dimensions is increased. By contrast, estimates of phylogenetic signal found with a squared-change parsimony procedure for multivariate data change with increasing trait variation among species and with increasing numbers of trait dimensions, confounding biological interpretations. I also evaluate the statistical performance of hypothesis testing procedures based on Kmult and find that the method displays appropriate Type I error and high statistical power for detecting phylogenetic signal in high-dimensional data. Statistical properties of Kmult were consistent for simulations using bifurcating and random phylogenies, for simulations using different numbers of species, for simulations that varied the number of trait dimensions, and for different underlying models of trait covariance structure. Overall these findings demonstrate that Kmult provides a useful means of evaluating phylogenetic signal in high-dimensional multivariate traits. Finally, I illustrate the utility of the new approach by evaluating the strength of phylogenetic signal for head shape in a lineage of Plethodon salamanders.},

abstract = {• A central aim of biogeography is to understand when and how modern patterns of species diversity and distribution developed. Many plant groups have disjunct distributions within the Northern Hemisphere, but among these very few have been studied that prefer warm semi-arid habitats. • Here we examine the biogeography and diversification history of Juniperus, which occurs in semi-arid habitats through much of the Northern Hemisphere. A phylogeny was generated based on {\textgreater} 10,000 bp of cpDNA for 51 Juniperus species plus many outgroups. Phylogenies based on fewer species were also constructed based on nuclear internal transcribed spacer (nrITS) and combined nrITS/cpDNA data sets to check for congruence. Divergence time-scales and ancestral distributions were further inferred. • Both long dispersal and migration across land bridges probably contributed to the modern range of Juniperus, while long-term climatic changes and the uplift of the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau probably drove its diversification. Diversification apparently slowed down during climate-stable period of the Oligocene, and then speeded up from the Miocene onwards. • Juniperus probably originated in Eurasia, and was a part of the south Eurasian Tethyan vegetation of the Eocene to Oligocene. It reached America once at this time, once in the Miocene and once more recently.},

Reconstructing ancestry is the focus of many biological studies but failure to distinguish between present-day descendants and long-dead ancestors has led to incorrect interpretation of phylogenetic trees. This has resulted in erroneous reconstruction of traits such as morphology and ancestral areas. Misinterpretation becomes evident when authors use the terms 'basal' or 'early diverging' to refer to extant taxa. Here, we discuss the correct interpretation of trees and methods for reconstructing the ancestral features of organisms using recently developed statistical models. These models can be inaccurate unless they use information that is independent of phylogenies, such as genetics, molecular and developmental biology, functional morphology, geological and climatic processes, and the fossil record.},

abstract = {We have sequenced two sections of chloroplast DNA from adzuki bean (Vigna angularis), containing the junctions between the inverted repeat (IR) and large single copy (LSC) regions of the genome. The gene order at both junctions is different from that described for other members of the legume family, such as Lotus japonicus and soybean. These differences have been attributed to an apparent 78-kb inversion that spans nearly the entire LSC region and which is present in adzuki and its close relative, the common bean. This 78-kb rearrangement broke the large S10 operon of ribosomal proteins into two smaller operons, one at each end of the LSC, without affecting the gene content of the genome. It disrupted the physical and transcriptional relationship between the six-gene rpl23-rpl14 cluster and the four-gene rps8-rpoA cluster that is conserved in most land plants. Analysis of the endpoints of the rearrangement indicates that it probably occurred by means of a two-step process of expansion and contraction of the IR and not by a 78-kb inversion.},

abstract = {Nuclear 26S rDNA sequences were used to corroborate and test previously published matK-rbcL-based hypotheses of phylogenetic relationships in Cornales. Sequences were generated for 53 taxa including Alangium, Camptotheca, Cornus, Curtisia, Davidia, Diplopanax, Mastixia, Nyssa, and four families: Grubbiaceae, Hydrangeaceae, Hydrostachyaceae, and Loasaceae. Fifteen taxa from asterids were used as outgroups. The 26S rDNA sequences were initially analyzed separately and then combined with matK-rbcL sequences, using both parsimony and maximum likelihood methods. Eight strongly supported major clades were identified within Cornales by all analyses: Cornus, Alangium, nyssoids (Nyssa, Davidia, and Camptotheca), mastixioids (Mastixia and Diplopanax), Hydrangeaceae, Loasaceae, Grubbia-Curtisia, and Hydrostachys. However, relationships among the major lineages are not strongly supported in either 26S rDNA or combined 26S rDNA-matK-rbcL topologies, except for the sister relationships between Cornus and Alangium and between nyssoids and mastixioids in the tree from combined data. Discrepancies in relationships among major lineages, especially the placement of the long-branched Hydrostachys, were found between parsimony and maximum likelihood trees in all analyses. Incongruence between the 26S rDNA and matK-rbcL data sets was suggested, where Hydrangeaceae was found to be largely responsible for the incongruence. The long branch of Hydrostachys revealed in previous analyses was reduced significantly with more sampling. Maximum likelihood analysis of combined 26S rDNA-matK-rbcL sequences suggested that Hydrostachys might be sister to the remainder of Cornales, that Cornus-Alangium are sisters, that nyssoids-mastixioids are sisters, and that Hydrangeaceae-Loasaceae are sisters, consistent with previous analyses of matK-rbcL sequence data.},

This provides a scaling from plant traits to ecological communities while bypassing the complications of population dynamics. Our method treats community development as a sorting process involving species that are ecologically equivalent except with respect to particular functional traits, which leads to a constrained random assembly of species; the relative abundance of each species adheres to a general exponential distribution as a function of its traits. Using data for eight functional traits of 30 herbaceous species and community-aggregated values of these traits in 12 sites along a 42-year chronosequence of secondary succession, we predicted 94{\%} of the variance in the relative abundances.},

A critical research need is to better integrate and reconcile the three major lines of evidence used to infer the existence of past refugia – fossil records, species distribution models and phylogeographic surveys – in order to characterize the complex spatiotemporal trajectories of species and populations in and out of refugia. Here we review the complementary strengths, limitations and new advances for these three approaches. We provide case studies to illustrate their combined application, and point thewaytowardsnewopportunities for synthesizing these disparate lines of evidence. Case studies with European beech, Qinghai spruce and Douglas-fir illustrate how the combination of these three approaches successfully resolves complex species histories not attainable from any one approach. Promising new statistical techniques can capitalize on the strengths of each method and provide a robust quantitative reconstruction of species history. Studying past refugia can help identify contemporary refugia and clarify their conservation significance, in particular by elucidating the fine-scale processes and the particular geographic locations that buffer species against rapidly changing climate.},

abstract = {Lack of complete chloroplast genome sequences is still one of the major limitations to extending chloroplast genetic engineering technology to useful crops. Therefore, we sequenced the soybean chloroplast genome and compared it to the other completely sequenced legumes, Lotus and Medicago. The chloroplast genome of Glycine is 152,218 basepairs (bp) in length, including a pair of inverted repeats of 25,574 bp of identical sequence separated by a small single copy region of 17,895 bp and a large single copy region of 83,175 bp. The genome contains 111 unique genes, and 19 of these are duplicated in the inverted repeat (IR). Comparisons of Glycine, Lotus and Medicago confirm the organization of legume chloroplast genomes based on previous studies. Gene content of the three legumes is nearly identical. The rpl22 gene is missing from all three legumes, and Medicago is missing rps16 and one copy of the IR. Gene order in Glycine, Lotus, and Medicago differs from the usual gene order for angiosperm chloroplast genomes by the presence of a single, large inversion of 51 kilobases (kb). Detailed analyses of repeated sequences indicate that many of the Glycine repeats that are located in the intergenic spacer regions and introns occur in the same location in the other legumes and in Arabidopsis, suggesting that they may play some functional role. The presence of small repeats of psbA and rbcL in legumes that have lost one copy of the IR indicate that this loss has only occurred once during the evolutionary history of legumes. {\textcopyright} Springer 2005.

abstract = {Mespilus and Crataegus are sister genera in Rosaceae tribe Pyreae. Mespilus has been seen to comprise not only the medlar, Mespilus germanica, of western Eurasia but also the Arkansas, U.S.A. endemic, Mespilus canescens. Crataegus, on the other hand, consists of 140–200 species found throughout the northern hemisphere. Diagnoses of these two genera rely on morphological features of leaves, flowers and fruits. However, character states supposed to be diagnostic of Mespilus occur in species of Crataegus. We used two nuclear (ribosomal ITS and LEAFY intron2) and four intergenic chloroplast DNA regions (trnS-trnG, psbA-trnH, trnH-rpl2, and rpl20-rps12)to estimate the phylogeny of Mespilus and Crataegus. Maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian analyses all corroborate the sister group relationship between Crataegus and Mespilus, and Crataegus brachyacantha sister to the rest of Crataegus. However, incongruence between chloroplast and nuclear data supports the hypothesis of a hybrid origin for Mespilus canescens, with Crataegus brachyacantha or its ancestor as the maternal parent. Accordingly, we (1) restrict Crataegus section Brevispinae to Crataegus brachyacantha (2) distinguish the Arkansas endemic as a nothospecies; (3) describe a new section and a new nothosection within Crataegus to contain the former species of Mespilus and Crataemespilus; and (4) make two new combinations under Crataegus.},

Since RGR is usually calculated using destructive harvests of several individuals, an obvious approach is to substitute W-1 and W-2 with sample means (W) over bar (1) and (W) over bar (2). Here we demonstrate that this approach yields a biased estimate of RGR whenever the variance of the natural logarithm-transformed plant weight changes through time. This bias increases with an increase in the variance in RGR, in the length of the interval between harvests, or in sample size. The bias can be avoided by using the formula RGR = ((ln W-2) over bar-(ln W-1) over bar)/(t(2) - t(1)), where (ln W-1) over bar and (ln W-2) over bar are the means of the natural logarithm-transformed plant weights.

abstract = {Restingas are considered stressful habitats associated with the Brazilian Atlantic forest, and their ecological interactions are poorly known. The goal of the present study was to determine the potential role of frugivorous birds as seed dispersers in a restinga habitat. Data were collected in Parque Nacional da Restinga de Jurubatiba, southeastern Brazil, where the main physiognomy (Open Clusia Formation) is characterized by the presence of patches of vegetation covering 20 to 48 {\%} of the sandy soil and reaching a height of 5 m. Birds were captured with mist nets (12 x 2.5 m; 36 mm mesh; 1,680 net-hrs) and had their fecal and regurgitate samples inspected for seeds. Six plant species found in these bird samples were studied. The germination of seeds obtained from plants was compared to those from the birds. Both groups of seeds were set on Petri dishes at room temperature and washed when infected with fungi. In general, there was no effect on germination rate, and the effect on germination speed was negative. Germination of seeds from Pilosocereus arrabidae treated by the birds seemed to be influenced by storage of defecated seeds, while few Miconia cinnamomifolia seeds both from plants and from birds germinated. Ocotea notata presented a great variation in time to the onset of germination, perhaps an advantage against dissecation. Aechmea nudicaulis, Clusia hilariana and Erythroxylum subsessile probably take advantage of the arrival to favorable microhabitats, not by the gut effect on the seeds. All plant species studied are numerically important for the community and some of them are main actors in the succession of vegetation patches. Among the birds, Mimus gilvus is an important resident species, endemic to restingas in Brazil, while Turdus amaurochalinus is a visitor and may be important for plants that fructify during its passage by the study site. Although the effect of pulp removal was only tested for one species (Achmea nudicaulis) in the present study, we confirmed that the tested effect of restinga frugivorous birds on seed germination was generally null. Although there is a need for more detailed studies on specific animal-plant interactions on this habitat, the overall effect of the birds on seed dispersal in restinga is probably positive.},

abstract = {Molecular-dating techniques potentially enable us to estimate the time of origin of any biological lineage. Such techniques were originally premised on the assumption of a 'molecular clock'; that is, the assumption that genetic change accumulated steadily over time. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that constant rates of molecular evolution might be the exception rather than the rule. Recently, new methods have appeared that enable the incorporation of variable rates into molecular dating. Direct comparisons between these methods are difficult, because they differ in so many respects. However, the assumptions about rate change on which they rely fall into a few broad categories. Improving our understanding of molecular evolution will be an important next step towards evaluating and improving these methods. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In order to compare the effectiveness of birds and insects as pollinators, we studied the floral biology of the bromeliad Aechmea nudicaulis (L.) Grisebach in the biome of the Atlantic rain forest, southern Brazil. On Santa Catarina Island, flowering extends from mid-September to the end of December, with diurnal anthesis. The reproductive system is obligatory xenogamy, thus pollinator-dependent. Flowers secrete 31.84 $\mu$l of nectar per day, with a mean sugar concentration of 23.2{\%}. Highest nectar volume and sugar concentration occur at the beginning of anthesis. Most floral traits are characteristic for ornithophily, and nectar production appears to be adapted to the energy demand of hummingbirds. Continued secretion of the sucrose-dominated nectar attracts and binds visitors to inflorescences, strengthening trapline foraging behaviour. Experiments assessing seed set after single flower visits were performed with the most frequent visitors, revealing the hummingbird Thalurania glaucopis as the most effective pollen vector. In addition, bees are also functional pollinators, as substantiated by their high visitation frequency. We conclude that this pollination system is bimodal. Thus, there is redundancy in the pollination service provided by birds and bees, granting a high probability of successful reproduction in Ae. nudicaulis.},

abstract = {Volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions are affected by a variety of biotic and abiotic factors such as light intensity, temperature, CO2 and drought. Another stress factor, usually overlooked but very important for the Amazon region, is flooding. We studied the exchange of VOCs in relation to CO2 exchange and transpiration of 8 common tree species from the Amazonian floodplain forest grown up from seeds using a dynamic enclosure system. Analysis of volatile organics was performed by PTR-MS fast online measurements. Our study confirmed emissions of ethanol and acetaldehyde at the beginning of root anoxia after inundation, especially in less anoxia adapted species such as Vatairea guianensis, but not for Hevea spruceana probably due to a better adapted metabolism. In contrast to short-term inundation, long-term flooding of the root system did not result in any emission of ethanol or/and acetaldehyde. Emission of other VOCs, such as isoprenoids, acetone, and methanol exhibited distinct behavior related to the origin (igap{\'{o}} or v{\'{a}}rzea type of floodplain) of the tree species. Also physiological activities exhibited different response patterns for trees from igap{\'{o}} or v{\'{a}}rzea. In general, isoprenoid emissions increased within the course of some days of short-term flooding. After a long period of waterlogging, VOC emissions decreased considerably, along with photosynthesis, transpiration and stomatal conductance. However, even under long-term testing conditions, two tree species did not show any significant decrease or increase in photosynthesis. In order to understand ecophysiological advantages of the different responses we need field investigations with adult tree species.},

abstract = {Nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions were used to address questions about the taxonomy, phylogeny, and biogeography of the hazelnut genus, Corylus (Betulaceae). The ITS phylogeny supports the recognition of two sections within the genus: section Acanthochlamys comprising the basal extant lineage Corylus ferox, and section Corylus consisting of the remainder of the genus. Within section Corylus, recognition of three subsections is supported: subsection Corylus (species with leafy, more or less bell-shaped involucres), subsection Colurnae (tree species with deeply dissected involucres), and subsection Siphonochlamys (species with tubular involucres). The ITS sequence divergence among species within Corylus is low, corresponding with that of most other North Temperate disjunct taxa. A few morphological characters were added to the analysis to boost support for branches. Migration between Asia and North America via the Bering land bridge is suggested by subsection Siphonochlamys while long distance dispersal from Europe to North America during the late Tertiary is suggested by the close relationship and lack of sequence divergence among members of subsection Corylus. A close biogeopraphic relationship among areas of eastern Asia, the Himalayas, and the Mediterranean region is suggested by the subsection Colurnae clade.},

abstract = {Phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences of six species of Platanus were conducted to estimate species relationships and analyze biogeographic history. On the basis of a broader analysis of the third exon of the nuclear gene LEAFY, the root node for the genus was confirmed to fall between subg. Castaneophyllum (P kerrii) and the species of subg. Platanus. Separate phylogenetic analyses of the nuclear ribosomal ITS region, the 3' region of the second intron of LEAFY, and the chloroplast region trnT-trnL intergenic spacer provided various levels of resolution, and the combined data yielded a fully resolved set of relationships within subg. Platanus. Two major clades were identified: one with species from Europe (EUR) and western North America (WNA) (R orientalis, P racemosa s.l.), the other with species from eastern North America (ENA; US and Canada) and eastern Mexico (EMEX) (P mexicana, P occidentalis, and R rzedowskii). Within subg. Platanus, six subclades corresponded to previously recognized taxa, and one accession may be of hybrid origin. The historical biogeography of Platanus was interpreted using phylogenetic pattern, estimates of divergence times, the fossil record, and climate reconstructions. The pattern of relationships was consistent with a hypothesis of vicariance and the oldest divergence between taxa within the set of area relationships of ((WNA + EUR), (ENA + MEX)) suggested an initial barrier affecting taxa that are now mostly confined to North America. The second oldest divergence within subg. Platamis involves the intercontinental disjunction of semi-arid species from WNA + EUR, which diverged by at least 15 MYBP, consistent with the Madrean-Tethyan hypothesis. Calibrated phylogenies were used to estimate divergence times for five more recent intracontinental disjunctions. These times correlated with the timing of geological events in Southwestern North America and northern Latin America.},

SDTFs have few widespread woody plant species causing high P-diversity between separate areas of forests. These separate areas contain geologically old, monophyletic clades of endemic plant species that often have geographically structured intraspecific genetic variation. These patterns of diversity, endemism, and phylogeny indicate a stable, dispersal-limited SDTF system. SDTF species tend to belong to larger clades confined to this vegetation, exemplifying phylogenetic niche conservatism, and we argue that this is evidence that the SDTF is a metacommunity (biome) for woody plant clades. That phylogenetic, population genetic, biogeographic, and community ecological patterns differ in woody plants from tropical rain forests and savannas suggests a hypothesis that broad ecological settings strongly influence plant diversification in the tropics.},

Progress in deriving predictive relationships between various characteristics and transforms of hyperspectral reflectance data are evaluated and the roles of leaf and canopy radiative transfer models are reviewed. Requirements are identified for more extensive intercomparisons of different approaches and for further work on the strategies for interpreting canopy scale data. The paper examines the prospects for extending research to the wider range of pigments in addition to chlorophyll, testing emerging methods of hyperspectral analysis and exploring the fusion of hyperspectral and LIDAR remote sensing. In spite of these opportunities for further development and the refinement of techniques, current evidence of an expanding range of applications in the ecophysiological, environmental, agricultural, and forestry sciences highlights the growing value of hyperspectral remote sensing of plant pigments.},

abstract = {An adaptationist programme has dominated evolutionary thought in England and the United States during the past 40 years. It is based on faith in the power of natural selection as an optimizing agent. It proceeds by breaking an oragnism into unitary 'traits' and proposing an adaptive story for each considered separately. Trade-offs among competing selective demands exert the only brake upon perfection; non-optimality is thereby rendered as a result of adaptation as well. We criticize this approach and attempt to reassert a competing notion (long popular in continental Europe) that organisms must be analysed as integrated wholes, with Baupl{\"{a}}ne so constrained by phyletic heritage, pathways of development and general architecture that the constraints themselves become more interesting and more important in delimiting pathways of change than the selective force that may mediate change when it occurs. We fault the adaptationist programme for its failure to distinguish current utility from reasons for origin (male tyrannosaurs may have used their diminutive front legs to titillate female partners, but this will not explain why they got so small); for its unwillingness to consider alternatives to adaptive stories; for its reliance upon plausibility alone as a criterion for accepting speculative tales; and for its failure to consider adequately such competing themes as random fixation of alleles, production of non-adaptive structures by developmental correlation with selected features (allometry, pleiotropy, material compensation, mechanically forced correlation), the separability of adaptation and selection, multiple adaptive peaks, and current utility as an epiphenomenon of non-adaptive structures. We support Darwin's own pluralistic approach to identifying the agents of evolutionary change.},

Rhysocaryon). J. Torrey Bot. Soc. 136: 1-25. 2009.-The tree genus Jttglans (nogal, walnut) is generally thought of as a north temperate group, but most of the 16 species of black walnuts (Juglans sect. Rhysocaryon) occur in subtropical areas of the New World, spanning Central America, Andean South America, and the Greater Antilles. The two species native to Central America (J. olanchana var. olanchana and J. steyermarkii) and two closely related Mexican taxa (J. olanchana var. standleyi and J. pyrifortnis) have not been studied thoroughly from a comparative systematic perspective, so here we provide a detailed investigation of their morphology and natural history as a first step towards a broad-based synthesis of J. sect. Rhysocaryon. Fieldwork in Guatemala and Mexico provided the material for germination studies, morphological analyses, and phylogenetic reconstruction using DNA sequences. Juglans steyermarkii was rediscovered in its type locality in Guatemala, and new populations were located during the course of fieldwork. SEM analysis of trichome diversity and density, along with leaflet shape, provided characters to differentiate among five taxa of Juglans in the accompanying key. Staminate flowers and pollen examined for the first time in J. steyermarkii showed close morphological similarities to those of other species of black walnuts. Variation in the pattern of nut-wall sculpture appears to be a promising source of variation; however, adequate capture and quantification of this variation will likely require three-dimensional scanning techniques. There was high variability in percent seed germination of the two Central American species and no observed advantage to leaching, scarification, or a prolonged stratification period. DNA studies included in the exploration of three promising sources of nuclear sequence variation: the ETS and ITS (external and internal transcribed spacer of ribosomal DNA), and the second intron of the LEAFY gene. Combined phylogenetic analysis of these sequences provided a moderately resolved topology containing two major groups of black walnuts and a general correlation between phylogeny and geography. The analyses supported a division between taxa from northern Mexico and the USA, and those from southern Mexico, Guatemala, the West Indies (Greater Antilles), and South America. Observations on the geographic range of Juglans in Mexico and Guatemala indicated a frequent association with coffee plantations, suggesting similar climatic requirements. Our studies of the dispersed and most likely fragmented populations indicate that Juglans may still be found in native plant communities as a canopy tree, although it is much more common to observe populations in cleared areas where the trees were retained as shade for coffee. We are not aware of any major efforts to conserve the native nogal in Central America, though they are sometimes left and/or planted as shade trees in coffee fincas. A study conducted in Mexico suggests that Juglans might be useful in agroforestry efforts to rehabilitate degraded sites.},

We constructed a molecular supermatrix for mammalian families and analyzed these data with likelihood-based methods and relaxed molecular clocks. Phylogenetic analyses resulted in a robust phylogeny with better resolution than phylogenies from supertree methods. Relaxed clock analyses support the long-fuse model of diversification and highlight the importance of including multiple fossil calibrations that are spread across the tree. Molecular time trees and diversification analyses suggest important roles for the Cretaceous Terrestrial Revolution and Cretaceous-Paleogene (KPg) mass extinction in opening up ecospace that promoted interordinal and intraordinal diversification, respectively. By contrast, diversification analyses provide no support for the hypothesis concerning the delayed rise of present-day mammals during the Eocene Period.},

abstract = {The mutually beneficial interactions between plants and their animal pollinators and seed dispersers have been paramount in the generation of Earth's biodiversity. These mutualistic interactions often involve dozens or even hundreds of species that form complex networks of interdependences. Understanding how coevolution proceed in these highly diversified mutualisms among free-living species presents a conceptual challenge. Recent work has led to the unambiguous conclusion that mutualistic networks are very heterogeneous (the bulk of the species have a few interactions, but a few species are much more connected than expected by chance), nested (specialists interact with subsets of the species with which generalists interact), and built on weak and asymmetric links among species. Both ecological variables (e.g., pheology, local abundance, and geographic range) and past evolutionary history may explain such network patterns. Network structure ahs important implications for the coexistence and stability of species as well as for the coevolutionary process. Mutualistic networks can thus be regarded as the architecture of biodiversity.},

abstract = {Floral evolution has often been associated with differences in pollina- tion syndromes. Recently, this conceptual structure has been criticized on the grounds that flowers attract a broader spectrum of visitors than one might expect based on their syndromes and that flowers often diverge without excluding one type of pollinator in favorof another. Despite these criticisms, we showthat pollination syndromes provide great utility in understanding the mechanisms of floral diversification. Our conclusions are based on the importance of organizing pollinators into functional groups according to presumed similarities in the selection pressures they exert. Furthermore, functional groups vary widely in their effectiveness as pollinators for particular plant species. Thus, although a plant may be visited by several functional groups, the relative se- lective pressures they exert will likely be very different.We discuss various methods of documenting selection on floral traits. Our review of the literature indicates over- whelming evidence that functional groups exert different selection pressures on floral traits.We also discuss the gaps in our knowledge of the mechanisms that underlie the evolution of pollination syndromes. In particular, we need more information about the relative importance of specific traits in pollination shifts, about what selective factors favor shifts between functional groups, about whether selection acts on traits inde- pendently or in combination, and about the role of history in pollination-syndrome evolution.},

abstract = {To place a new fossil occurrence of Sacoglottis in a broader context, we surveyed the fruit morphology of all extant genera of the Humiriaceae, conducted a cladistic analysis, and critically reviewed the fossil record for this family. Living and fossil fruits of Humiriaceae are recognized by a woody endocarp, germination valves, and, in some genera, wall cavities. The phylogenetic analysis based on 40 morphological characters yielded two most parsimonious trees indicating Vantanea as sister taxon to all genera among Humiriaceae. Schistostemon is indistinguishable from Sacoglottis in fruit morphology and is recovered as sister to Sacoglottis in the topology; we recommend restoring Schistostemon to the rank of subgenus within Sacoglottis. A review of prior published reports of fossil fruits attributed to Humiriaceae led to the rejection and/or reattribution of some records but supports recognition of Vantanea, Humiria, Humiriastrum, and Sacoglottis. The available characters do not support recognition of multiple fossil species of Sacoglottis. We recognize the occurrence of Sacoglottis tertiaria Berry emend. Herrera from Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and a newly collected Miocene site from Panama. The Cenozoic fossil record of Humiriaceae in South and Central America, together with discreditation of former reports from Europe, strongly supports a Neotropical origin for this family.},

A total of 130 sets of sequences (nuLSU rDNA, nuITS rDNA and RPB1 region A-D), including 129 newly generated sequences, were analysed. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred using a Bayesian approach based on two datasets. A first analysis of a larger, two-locus dataset (nuLSU and RPB1) for 128 members of the Verrucariaceae, confirmed the polyphyly of Polyblastia, Thelidium, Staurothele, and Verrucaria, as currently construed. The second analysis focused on 56 Polyblastia and allied taxa, but using an additional locus (nuITS rDNA) and two closely related outgroup taxa. The latter analysis revealed strongly supported groups, such as Polyblastia s. str., the Thelidium group (a mixture of Polyblastia, Thelidium, Staurothele and Verrucaria species). The genus Sporodictyon, which is here accepted, also accommodates Sporodictyon terrestre comb. nov. Morphological features traditionally used for characterizing Polyblastia, Thelidium, Staurothele and Verrucaria, such as spore septation and colour, occurrence of hymenial photobiont, involucrellum structure, and substrate preference, were found to be only partially consistent within the strongly supported clades, and thus are not always reliable features for characterizing natural groups. {\textcopyright} 2008 The British Mycological Society.},

abstract = {Predicting community and species responses to disturbance is complicated by incomplete knowledge about species traits. A phylogenetic framework should partially solve this problem, as trait similarity is generally correlated with species relatedness, closely related species should have similar sensitivities to disturbance. Disturbance should thus result in community assemblages of closely related species. We tested this hypothesis with 18 disturbed and 16 reference whole-lake, long-term zooplankton data sets. Regardless of disturbance type, communities generally contained more closely related species when disturbed. This effect was independent of species richness, evenness, and abundance. Communities already under stress (i.e., those in acidic lakes) changed most when disturbed. Species sensitivities to specific disturbances were phylogenetically conserved, were independent of body size, and could be predicted by the sensitivities of close relatives within the same community. Phylogenetic relatedness can effectively act as a proxy for missing trait information when predicting community and species responses to disturbance},

These models were originally developed for Panamanian trees and successfully reproduce observed distributions of abundance. Neutral models also make macroevolutionary predictions that have rarely been evaluated or tested. Here we show that neutral models predict a humped or flat relationship between species age and population size. In contrast, ages and abundances of tree species in the Panamanian Canal watershed are found to be positively correlated, which falsifies the models. Speciation rates vary among phylogenetic lineages and are partially heritable from mother to daughter species. Variable speciation rates in an otherwise neutral model lead to a demographic advantage for species with low speciation rate. This demographic advantage results in a positive correlation between species age and abundance, as found in the Panamanian tropical forest community.},

abstract = {The cacti are one of the most celebrated radiations of succulent plants. There has been much speculation about their age, but progress in dating cactus origins has been hindered by the lack of fossil data for cacti or their close relatives. Using a hybrid phylogenomic approach, we estimated that the cactus lineage diverged from its closest relatives ≈35 million years ago (Ma). However, major diversification events in cacti were more recent, with most species-rich clades originating in the late Miocene, ≈10-5 Ma. Diversification rates of several cactus lineages rival other estimates of extremely rapid speciation in plants. Major cactus radiations were contemporaneous with those of South African ice plants and North American agaves, revealing a simultaneous diversification of several of the world's major succulent plant lineages across multiple continents. This short geological time period also harbored the majority of origins of C(4) photosynthesis and the global rise of C(4) grasslands. A global expansion of arid environments during this time could have provided new ecological opportunity for both succulent and C(4) plant syndromes. Alternatively, recent work has identified a substantial decline in atmospheric CO(2) ≈15-8 Ma, which would have strongly favored C(4) evolution and expansion of C(4)-dominated grasslands. Lowered atmospheric CO(2) would also substantially exacerbate plant water stress in marginally arid environments, providing preadapted succulent plants with a sharp advantage in a broader set of ecological conditions and promoting their rapid diversification across the landscape.},

abstract = {The study of interspecific variation in plant ecological strategies has revealed suites of traits associated with leaf life span and with maximum levels of water deficit (measured as leaf water potentials). Here, the relationship between these sets of traits was examined in a study of 20 co-occurring chaparral shrubs that vary in leaf habit, rooting depth, and regeneration strategies. Leaf life span (LLS) and minimum seasonal water potentials (psi(min)) were not significantly correlated, suggesting that they are associated with independent aspects of functional variation. Multiple regression analyses of a large suite of physiological, functional, and phenological attributes in relation to these two "anchor traits" supported this view. Short LLS was significantly associated with high specific leaf area, hi-h carbon assimilation and leaf nitrogen (per mass), early onset of growth, and a multistemmed, short stature growth form. This suite of traits was also associated with opportunistic regeneration following physical disturbance. Area-based gas exchange was not tightly linked to LLS. Low psi(min) (i.e., greater water deficit) was associated with high wood density, small vessel diameters, thin twigs, low leaf area: sapwood area ratios, and early onset of leaf abscission. Among the evergreen species, this suite of traits was most characteristic of post-fire seeders, which depend on high drought tolerance for post-fire regeneration of seedlings. Plant stature was the only trait associated with both the LLS axis and the psi(min) axis of functional variation. A two-dimensional strategy space, approximately defined by LLS and psi(min), can be used to distinguish contrasting strategies of drought tolerance vs. avoidance, and alternative modes of regeneration following fire and other disturbance. This conceptual scheme illustrates the strength of a trait-based approach to defining plant strategies in relation to resource availability and disturbance.},

abstract = {Understanding the impact of climate-induced distributional shifts on species divergence, like those accompanying the Pleistocene glacial cycles [1, 2], requires tools that explicitly incorporate the geographic configuration of past distributions into analyses of genetic differentiation. Depending on the historical distribution of species, genetic differences may accumulate among ancestral source populations, but there is long-standing debate whether displacements into glacial refugia promoted divergence. Here we integrate coalescent-based genetic models [3, 4] with ecological-niche modeling [5, 6] to generate expectations for patterns of genetic variation based on an inferred past distribution of a species. Reconstruction of the distribution of a montane grasshopper species during the last glacial maximum suggests that Melanoplus marshalli populations from the sky islands of Colorado and Utah were likely colonized from multiple ancestral source populations. The genetic analyses provide compelling evidence that the historical distribution of M. marshalli-namely, spatial separation of multiple refugia-was conducive to genetic differentiation. The coupling of genetic and ecological-niche modeling provides a new and flexible tool for integrating paleoenvironmental details into species-specific predictions of population structure that can increase our understanding of why the glacial cycles promoted speciation in some taxa and yet inhibited diversification in others [7, 8]. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The relative influence of Neogene geomorphological events and Quaternary climatic changes as causal mechanisms on Neotropical diversification remains largely speculative, as most divergence timing inferences are based on a single locus and have limited taxonomic or geographic sampling. To investigate these influences, we use a multilocus (two mitochondrial and 11 nuclear genes) range-wide sampling of Phyllopezus pollicaris, a gecko complex widely distributed across the poorly studied South American 'dry diagonal' biomes. Our approach couples traditional and model-based phylogeography with geospatial methods, and demonstrates Miocene diversification and limited influence of Pleistocene climatic fluctuations on P. pollicaris. Phylogeographic structure and distribution models highlight that persistence across multiple isolated regions shaped the diversification of this species complex. Approximate Bayesian computation supports hypotheses of allopatric and ecological/sympatric speciation between lineages that largely coincide with genetic clusters associated with Chaco, Cerrado, and Caatinga, standing for complex diversification between the 'dry diagonal' biomes. We recover extremely high genetic diversity and suggest that eight well-supported clades may be valid species, with direct implications for taxonomy and conservation assessments. These patterns exemplify how low-vagility species complexes, characterized by strong genetic structure and pre-Pleistocene divergence histories, represent ideal radiations to investigate broad biogeographic histories of associated biomes.},

abstract = {Abstract: If an ancestral stem group repeatedly colonizes similar environments, developmental plasticity specific to that group should consistently give rise to similar phenotypes. Parallel selection on those similar phenotypes could lead to the repeated evolution of characteristic ecotypes, a property common to many adaptive radiations. A key prediction of this “flexible stem” model of adaptive radiation is that patterns of phenotypic divergence in derived groups should mirror patterns of developmental plasticity in their common ancestor. The threespine stickleback radiation provides an excellent opportunity to test this prediction because the marine form is representative of the ancestral stem group, which has repeatedly given rise to several characteristic ecotypes. We examined plasticity of several aspects of shape and trophic morphology in response to diets characteristic of either the derived benthic ecotype or the limnetic ecotype. When marine fish were reared on alternative diets, plasticity of head and mouth shape paralleled phenotypic divergence between the derived ecotypes, supporting the flexible stem model. Benthic and limnetic fish exhibited patterns of plasticity similar to those of the marine population; however, some differences in population means were present, as well as subtle differences in shape plasticity in the benthic population, indicating a role for genetic accommodation in this system.

abstract = {The Plio–Pleistocene refugia hypothesis recently gained support in explaining Brazilian Atlantic Forest megadiversity from combined analyses of species paleodistributions and genetic diversity. Here we examine genetic differentiation and historical distributions in the Rhinella crucifer group of toads, endemic to and widely distributed within this biome. We analyzed sequences of mitochondrial (control region, ND1, and ND2) and nuclear ($\beta$-crystallin and rhodopsin) DNA markers from 65 individuals representing five species. We found deep structure across the range at mitochondrial markers; genetic diversity is geographically structured in four main haplotype clades with the oldest divergence, dated to the Pliocene, between the southernmost populations and other regions of the species' range. Remaining populations are distributed in haplotype clades that may have diverged throughout the Pleistocene. Our paleoecological distribution models support a scenario of habitat fragmentation associated with glacial cycling, but we found limited congruence of phylogeographic patterns with the refugia. We found that some genetic breaks geographically coincide with putative barriers associated to neotectonic activity, but finer-scale sampling will be necessary to test the relative importance of distinct isolation mechanisms. Overall, the data refute the recently proposed hypothesis of a southern Holocene colonization of the Atlantic Forest from northern refugia, suggesting instead persistence of forested habitats in the south. Our unexpected results underscore the need to consider distinct organismal histories in planning biome-level conservation. We discuss species correspondence to clades recovered in our phylogenetic analyses.},

We present a trait-based approach that provides an additive decomposition of species' trait values into alpha and beta components: beta values refer to a species' position along a gradient defined by community-level mean trait values; alpha values are the difference between a species' trait values and the mean of co-occurring taxa. In woody plant communities of coastal California, beta trait values for specific leaf area, leaf size, wood density and maximum height all covary strongly, reflecting species distributions across a gradient of soil moisture availability. Alpha values, on the other hand, are generally not significantly correlated, suggesting several independent axes of differentiation within communities. This trait-based framework provides a novel approach to integrate functional ecology and gradient analysis with community ecology and coexistence theory.},

abstract = {AimThe fossil record has led to a historical explanation for forest diversity gradients within the cool parts of the Northern Hemisphere, founded on a limited ability of woody angiosperm clades to adapt to mid-Tertiary cooling. We tested four predictions of how this should be manifested in the phylogenetic structure of 91,340 communities: (1) forests to the north should comprise species from younger clades (families) than forests to the south; (2) average cold tolerance at a local site should be associated with the mean family age (MFA) of species; (3) minimum temperature should account for MFA better than alternative environmental variables; and (4) traits associated with survival in cold climates should evolve under a niche conservatism constraint. LocationThe contiguous United States. MethodsWe extracted angiosperms from the US Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis database. MFA was calculated by assigning age of the family to which each species belongs and averaging across the species in each community. We developed a phylogeny to identify phylogenetic signal in five traits: realized cold tolerance, seed size, seed dispersal mode, leaf phenology and height. Phylogenetic signal representation curves and phylogenetic generalized least squares were used to compare patterns of trait evolution against Brownian motion. Eleven predictors structured at broad or local scales were generated to explore relationships between environment and MFA using random forest and general linear models. ResultsConsistent with predictions, (1) southern communities comprise angiosperm species from older families than northern communities, (2) cold tolerance is the trait most strongly associated with local MFA, (3) minimum temperature in the coldest month is the environmental variable that best describes MFA, broad-scale variables being much stronger correlates than local-scale variables, and (4) the phylogenetic structures of cold tolerance and at least one other trait associated with survivorship in cold climates indicate niche conservatism. Main conclusionsTropical niche conservatism in the face of long-term climate change, probably initiated in the Late Cretaceous associated with the rise of the Rocky Mountains, is a strong driver of the phylogenetic structure of the angiosperm component of forest communities across the USA. However, local deterministic and/or stochastic processes account for perhaps a quarter of the variation in the MFA of local communities.},

In soybean, rice, and pine, PCR (polymerase chain reaction) with flanking primers has shown that the numbers of A or T residues in such repeats are variable among closely related taxa. Here we describe a set of primers for studying mononucleotide repeat variation in chloroplast DNA of angiosperms where database information is limited. A total of 39 (A)n and (T)n repeats (n {\textgreater} or = 10) were identified in the tobacco chloroplast genome, and DNA sequences encompassing these 39 regions were aligned with orthologous DNA sequences in the databases. Consensus primer pairs were constructed and used to amplify total genomic DNA from a hierarchical set of angiosperms. All 10 primer pairs generated PCR products from members of the Solanaceae, and 8 of the 10 were also functional in most other angiosperm species. Levels of interspecific polymorphism within the genera Nicotiana, Lycopersicon (both Solanaceae), and Actinidia (Actinidiaceae) proved to be high, while intraspecific variation in Nicotiana tabacum, Lycopersicon esculentum, and Actinidia chinensis was limited. Sequence analysis of PCR products from three primer pairs revealed variable numbers of A, G, and T residues in mononucleotide arrays as the major cause of polymorphism in Actinidia. Our results suggest that universal primers targeted to mononucleotide repeats may serve as general tools to study chloroplast variation in angiosperms.},

abstract = {The importance of competition between similar species in driving community assembly is much debated. Recently, phylogenetic patterns in species composition have been investigated to help resolve this question: phylogenetic clustering is taken to imply environmental filtering, and phylogenetic overdispersion to indicate limiting similarity between species. We used experimental plant communities with random species compositions and initially even abundance distributions to examine the development of phylogenetic pattern in species abundance distributions. Where composition was held constant by weeding, abundance distributions became overdispersed through time, but only in communities that contained distantly related clades, some with several species (i.e., a mix of closely and distantly related species). Phylogenetic pattern in composition therefore constrained the development of overdispersed abundance distributions, and this might indicate limiting similarity between close relatives and facilitation/complementarity between distant relatives. Comparing the phylogenetic patterns in these communities with those expected from the monoculture abundances of the constituent species revealed that interspecific competition caused the phylogenetic patterns. Opening experimental communities to colonization by all species in the species pool led to convergence in phylogenetic diversity. At convergence, communities were composed of several distantly related but species-rich clades and had overdispersed abundance distributions. This suggests that limiting similarity processes determine which species dominate a community but not which species occur in a community. Crucially, as our study was carried out in experimental communities, we could rule out local evolutionary or dispersal explanations for the patterns and identify ecological processes as the driving force, underlining the advantages of studying these processes in experimental communities. Our results show that phylogenetic relations between species provide a good guide to understanding community structure and add a new perspective to the evidence that niche complementarity is critical in driving community assembly.},

Thus, understanding phenotypic attributes that allow species to partition resources is fundamentally important to explaining diversity-productivity relationships.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we use data from a long-term experiment (Cedar Creek, MN) and compare the extent to which productivity is explained by seven types of community metrics of functional variation: 1) species richness, 2) variation in 10 individual traits, 3) functional group richness, 4) a distance-based measure of functional diversity, 5) a hierarchical multivariate clustering method, 6) a nonmetric multidimensional scaling approach, and 7) a phylogenetic diversity measure, summing phylogenetic branch lengths connecting community members together and may be a surrogate for ecological differences. Although most of these diversity measures provided significant explanations of variation in productivity, the presence of a nitrogen fixer and phylogenetic diversity were the two best explanatory variables. Further, a statistical model that included the presence of a nitrogen fixer, seed weight and phylogenetic diversity was a better explanation of community productivity than other models.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Evolutionary relationships among species appear to explain patterns of grassland productivity. Further, these results reveal that functional differences among species involve a complex suite of traits and that perhaps phylogenetic relationships provide a better measure of the diversity among species that contributes to productivity than individual or small groups of traits.},

However, these insights are sensitive to the spatial scale of analysis. Here, we use spatially explicit, neighbourhood models of tree growth and survival for 19 tree species, a highly resolved molecular phylogeny and information on eight functional traits to quantify the relative efficacy of functional similarity and shared ancestry in describing the effects of spatial interactions between tree species on demographic rates. We also assess the congruence of these results with observed phylogenetic and functional structure in the neighbourhoods of live and dead trees. We found strong support for models in which the effects of spatial neighbourhood interactions on tree growth and survival were scaled to species-specific mean functional trait values (e.g., wood specific gravity, leaf succulence and maximum height) but not to phylogenetic distance. The weak phylogenetic signal in functional trait data allowed us to independently interpret the static neighbourhood functional and phylogenetic patterns. We observed greater functional trait similarity in the neighbourhoods of live trees relative to those of dead trees suggesting that environmental filtering is the major force structuring this tree community at this scale while competitive interactions play a lesser role.},

abstract = {Restriction site variation in chloroplast DNA and nuclear ribosomal DNA was examined in 16 accessions from the Salicaceae comprising 10 species of Populus and one outgroup species of Salix. Some 49 restriction site mutations in the chloroplast DNAs were used to generate one most parsimonious phylogenetic tree. This tree indicates that all varieties of P. nigra (black poplars of sect. Aigeiros) have a chloroplast genome (maternally inherited) derived from the clade including the white poplars (P. alba and segregate species of sect. Populus) and divergent from the American cottonwoods of their own section. A total of 21 restriction site mutations in the nuclear ribosomal DNAs generated a single most parsimonious phylogenetic tree that indicates that the nuclear genome of P. nigra is distinct from those of both the white poplars and American cottonwoods. The incongruity of these independent molecular phylogenies provides evidence for an unusual origin of the black poplars. P. alba or its immediate ancestor acted as the maternal parent in a hybridization event with the paternal lineage of P. nigra. Subsequent backcrosses to the paternal species gave rise to the extant P. nigra with a chloroplast genome of P. alba and the nuclear genome of the paternal species. These hybridization and introgression events must have pre-dated the divergence of the black poplar varieties. The biphyletic nature of the P. nigra genomes suggests that dependency on one class of molecular or morphological markers or the merging of the two kinds of data sets to derive accurate estimates of true phylogenies could be misleading in plants.},

abstract = {Ecologists have long recognized the roles of competition and disturbance in shaping ecological communities, and the combinatorial effects of these two factors have been the subject of substantial ecological research. Nevertheless, it is still unclear whether competition remains as an important structuring force in habitats strongly influenced by disturbance. The conventional belief remains that the importance of competition decreases with increasing disturbance, but limited theory suggests otherwise. Using protist communities established in laboratory microcosms, we demonstrate that disturbance does not diminish the importance of competition. Interspecific competition significantly increased rates of species extinction over a broad disturbance gradient, and increasing disturbance intensities increased, rather than decreased, the tempo of competitive exclusion. This community-level pattern is linked to the species-level pattern that interspecific competition led to most frequent extinctions of each species at the highest level of disturbance that the species can tolerate. Consequently, despite a strong tradeoff between competitive ability and disturbance tolerance across the competing species, species diversity generally declined with disturbance. The consistent structuring role of competition throughout the disturbance gradient underscores the need to understand competitive interactions and their consequences even in highly disturbed habitats.},

abstract = {All comparative analyses rely on at least one phylogenetic hypothesis. However, the reconstruction of the evolutionary history of species is not the pri-mary aim of these studies. In fact, it is rarely the case that a well-resolved, fully matching phylogeny is available for the interspecific trait data at hand. Therefore, phylogenetic information usually needs to be combined across various sources that often rely on different approaches and different markers for the phylogenetic reconstruction. Building hypotheses about the evolutionary history of species is a challenging task, as it requires knowledge about the underlying methodology and an ability to flexibly manipulate data in diverse formats. Although most practi-tioners are not experts in phylogenetics, the appropriate handling of phylogenetic information is crucial for making evolutionary inferences in a comparative study, because the results will be proportional to the underlying phylogeny. In this chapter, we provide an overview on how to interpret and combine phylogenetic information from different sources, and review the various tree-tailoring tech-niques by touching upon issues that are crucial for the understanding of other chapters in this book. We conclude that whichever method is used to generate trees, the phylogenetic hypotheses will always include some uncertainty that should be taken into account in a comparative study.},

abstract = {The use of fossil sediments and genetic markers has allowed reconstruction of range shifts of forest trees induced by past climatic changes. Independently, studies of the ecology and population biology of human-induced tree invasions have started to appear. Here, we review the literature on the ecology and the genetics of past and contemporary invasions of forest trees and argue that population research dealing with past (natural) or with ongoing (human-induced) invasions should be better integrated. In particular, we suggest using identical terms to describe artificial and natural invasions, as this should help integrate the two fields. We then discuss the modalities of introduction of tree species, the life history traits associated with invasiveness, the importance of long-distance seed dispersal, the establishment of small populations, the role of biotic interactions and the specific contribution of palaeoecology to the study of tree invasions. Next, we discuss genetic and evolutionary aspects, including the genetic characteristics of invasive woody species, the genetic consequences of dispersal (founder effects and admixture), shifts in dispersal-related traits and in mating system and the importance of hybridization and introgression during invasion. We then review models of the genetic consequences of tree invasions, examine the possibility for rapid adaptation of trees to new environmental conditions and discuss the relative importance of environmental versus genetic factors in controlling tree invasions. We conclude by proposing solutions for two central "genetic paradoxes" of invasions. The first one is the necessity for invasive species to adapt to new conditions, which seems difficult to reconcile with the expected loss of diversity through founder events. The second is the common observation of invasive species outcompeting native ones, which does not seem to fit with the belief in widespread local adaptation. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The recent development of Bayesian phylogenetic inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques has facilitated the exploration of parameter-rich evolutionary models. At the same time, stochastic models have become more realistic (and complex) and have been extended to new types of data, such as morphology. Based on this foundation, we developed a Bayesian MCMC approach to the analysis of combined data sets and explored its utility in inferring relationships among gall wasps based on data from morphology and four genes (nuclear and mitochondrial, ribosomal and protein coding). Examined models range in complexity from those recognizing only a morphological and a molecular partition to those having complex substitution models with independent parameters for each gene. Bayesian MCMC analysis deals efficiently with complex models: convergence occurs faster and more predictably for complex models, mixing is adequate for all parameters even under very complex models, and the parameter update cycle is virtually unaffected by model partitioning across sites. Morphology contributed only 5{\%} of the characters in the data set but nevertheless influenced the combined-data tree, supporting the utility of morphological data in multigene analyses. We used Bayesian criteria (Bayes factors) to show that process heterogeneity across data partitions is a significant model component, although not as important as among-site rate variation. More complex evolutionary models are associated with more topological uncertainty and less conflict between morphology and molecules. Bayes factors sometimes favor simpler models over considerably more parameter-rich models, but the best model overall is also the most complex and Bayes factors do not support exclusion of apparently weak parameters from this model.

abstract = {Reid's paradox describes the fact that classical models cannot account for the rapid (10(2)-10(3) m yr-1) spread of trees at the end of the Pleistocene. I use field estimates of seed dispersal with an integrodifference equation and simulation models of population growth to show that dispersal data are compatible with rapid spread. Dispersal estimates lay to rest the possibility that rapid spread occurred by diffusion. The integrodifference model predicts that, if the seed shadow has a long 'fat' tail, then rapid spread is possible, despite short average dispersal distances. It further predicts that velocity is more sensitive to life history than is classical diffusion. Application of such models is frustrated because the tail of the seed shadow cannot be fitted to data. However, the data can be used to test a 'long-distance' hypothesis against alternative ('local') models of dispersal using Akaike's Information Criterion and likelihood ratio tests. Tests show that data are consistent with {\textgreater}10{\%} of seed dispersed as a long (10(2) m) fat-tailed kernel. Models based on such kernels predict spread as rapid as that inferred from the pollen record. If fat-tailed dispersal explains these rapid rates, then it is surprising not to see large differences in velocities among taxa with contrasting life histories. The inference of rapid spread, together with lack of obvious life-history effects, suggests velocities may have not reached their potentials, being stalled by rates of climate change, geography, or both.},

abstract = {(1) The establishment phase of Neobuxbumia tetetzo, a giant columnar cactus dominant in the Tehuacan Valley in central-southern Mexico, occurs mostly beneath the canopies of trees and shrubs which act as nurse plants. This pattern cannot be attributed to preferential seed dispersion, as Neobuxbaumia fruits open while still on the plant, dropping c. 1000 seeds fruit-1 randomly around the parent plant. (2) An experimental field analysis of germination and survivorship of cohorts under different environmental conditions was performed in order to determine the underlying mechanisms associated to the establishment of N. tetetzo beneath the canopies of Mimosa luisana, a legume which is the most abundant shrub in the community. The experimental treatments followed a factorial design, with three levels of radiation (open space, artificial homogeneous shade and the shade produced by Mimosa luisana), two levels of predation (exclusion and non-exclusion of predators), and four topographic aspects (north, east, south and west). (3) Seed germination was lowest in open spaces. In all treatments, exclusion from predators significantly increased seedling survival. Only the shaded treatments had live individuals at the end of the experiment, 2 years later. The results suggest that the nurse-plant effect between Neobuxbaumia tetetzo and Mimosa luisana is chiefly the result of differential survival in shaded microsites with less direct solar radiation, and consequently with lower daytime temperatures and lower evaporative demand. (4) In order to determine the generality of these results, field samplings were conducted in two Mexican deserts located outside the tropical belt: the Vizcaino Desert in Baja California and the Gran Desierto de Altar in Sonora. In these deserts direct solar radiation has a southern azimuth all year round. Five of six succulent species analysed showed a significant pattern of greater establishment on the shaded north sides of nurse plants. (5) The amelioration of the physical environment produced by the nurse plants is important in the patch-structurated population dynamics of many communities of desert plants.},

abstract = {Local adaptations to environmental conditions are of high ecological importance as they determine distribution ranges and likely affect species responses to climate change. Increased environmental stress (warming, extreme drought) due to climate change in combination with decreased genetic mixing due to isolation may lead to stronger local adaptations of geographically marginal than central populations. We experimentally observed local adaptations of three marginal and four central populations of Fagus sylvatica L., the dominant native forest tree, to frost over winter and in spring (late frost). We determined frost hardiness of buds and roots by the relative electrolyte leakage in two common garden experiments. The experiment at the cold site included a continuous warming treatment; the experiment at the warm site included a preceding summer drought manipulation. In both experiments, we found evidence for local adaptation to frost, with stronger signs of local adaptation in marginal populations. Winter frost killed many of the potted individuals at the cold site, with higher survival in the warming treatment and in those populations originating from colder environments. However, we found no difference in winter frost tolerance of buds among populations, implying that bud survival was not the main cue for mortality. Bud late frost tolerance in April differed between populations at the warm site, mainly because of phenological differences in bud break. Increased spring frost tolerance of plants which had experienced drought stress in the preceding summer could also be explained by shifts in phenology. Stronger local adaptations to climate in geographically marginal than central populations imply the potential for adaptation to climate at range edges. In times of climate change, however, it needs to be tested whether locally adapted populations at range margins can successfully adapt further to changing conditions.},

abstract = {Most existing methods for modeling trait evolution are univariate, although researchers are often interested in investigating evolutionary patterns and processes across multiple traits. Principal components analysis (PCA) is commonly used to reduce the dimensionality of multivariate data so that univariate trait models can be fit to individual principal components. The problem with using standard PCA on phylogenetically structured data has been previously pointed out yet it continues to be widely used in the literature. Here we demonstrate precisely how using standard PCA can mislead inferences: The first few principal components of traits evolved under constant-rate multivariate Brownian motion will appear to have evolved via an "early burst" process. A phylogenetic PCA (pPCA) has been proprosed to alleviate these issues. However, when the true model of trait evolution deviates from the model assumed in the calculation of the pPCA axes, we find that the use of pPCA suffers from similar artifacts as standard PCA. We show that data sets with high effective dimensionality are particularly likely to lead to erroneous inferences. Ultimately, all of the problems we report stem from the same underlying issue-by considering only the first few principal components as univariate traits, we are effectively examining a biased sample of a multivariate pattern. These results highlight the need for truly multivariate phylogenetic comparative methods. As these methods are still being developed, we discuss potential alternative strategies for using and interpreting models fit to univariate axes of multivariate data.},

Phylogenetic niche conservatism has important consequences for the assembly of both local communities and the regional species pools from which these are drawn. If corridors for movement are available, newly emerging environments will tend to be filled by species that filter in from areas in which the relevant adaptations have already evolved, as opposed to being filled by in situ evolution of these adaptations. Examples include intercontinental disjunctions of tropical plants, the spread of plant lineages around the Northern Hemisphere after the evolution of cold tolerance, and the radiation of northern alpine plants into the Andes. These observations highlight the role of phylogenetic knowledge and historical biogeography in explanations of global biodiversity patterns. They also have implications for the future of biodiversity.},

Minimal intra-individual and intraspecific polymorphisms were observed and infrageneric taxa were all recovered in phylogenetic analyses. The tree topologies estimated from parsimony and neighbor-joining analyses of one- and two-parameter substitution rates were congruent and supported by high bootstrap estimates. Indels were also found to be phylogenetically informative. The phylogenetic trees obtained were in quite good agreement with the current taxonomy of the genus but homoplasy was observed in the evolution of floral characters. Polyploidy also appeared to have evolved several times in the genus. Fraxinus nigra was more closely related to European and Asian taxa than to the other American ashes. The Asian F. platypoda had a closer relationship to Asian and European ashes in section Bumelioides than to its presumed North American allies of section Melioides. With respect to the position of F. quadrangulata as sister group to the remainder to the remaining species, the subgenus Fraxinus appeared paraphyletic. Phylogeographical analysis indicated that Fraxinus likely originated in North America, with two subsequent events of intercontinental migration from North America to Asia.},

abstract = {The congenital fusion of carpels, or syncarpy, is considered a key innovation as it is found in more than 80{\%} of angiosperms. Within the magnoliids however, syncarpy has rarely evolved. Two alternative evolutionary origins of syncarpy were suggested in order to explain the evolution of this feature: multiplication of a single carpel vs. fusion of a moderate number of carpels. The magnoliid family Annonaceae provides an ideal situation to test these hypotheses as two African genera, Isolona and Monodora, are syncarpous in an otherwise apocarpous family with multicarpellate and unicarpellate genera. In addition to syncarpy, the evolution of six other morphological characters was studied. Well-supported phylogenetic relationships of African Annonaceae and in particular those of Isolona and Monodora were reconstructed. Six plastid regions were sequenced and analyzed using maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference methods. The Bayesian posterior mapping approach to study character evolution was used as it accounts for both mapping and phylogenetic uncertainty, and also allows multiple state changes along the branches. Our phylogenetic analyses recovered a fully resolved clade comprising twelve genera endemic to Africa, including Isolona and Monodora, which was nested within the so-called long-branch clade. This is the largest and most species-rich clade of African genera identified to date within Annonaceae. The two syncarpous genera were inferred with maximum support to be sister to a clade characterized by genera with multicarpellate apocarpous gynoecia, supporting the hypothesis that syncarpy arose by fusion of a moderate number of carpels. This hypothesis was also favoured when studying the floral anatomy of both genera. Annonaceae provide the only case of a clear evolution of syncarpy within an otherwise apocarpous magnoliid family. The results presented here offer a better understanding of the evolution of syncarpy in Annonaceae and within angiosperms in general.},

abstract = {1. Ecologically significant evolutionary change, occurring over tens of generations or fewer, is now widely documented in nature. These findings counter the long-standing assumption that ecological and evolutionary processes occur on different time-scales, and thus that the study of ecological processes can safely assume evolutionary stasis. Recognition that substantial evolution occurs on ecological time-scales dissolves this dichotomy and provides new opportunities for integrative approaches to pressing ques-tions in many fields of biology. 2. The goals of this special feature are twofold: to consider the factors that influence evolution on ecological time-scales – phenotypic plasticity, maternal effects, sexual selection, and gene flow – and to assess the consequences of such evolution – for population persistence, speciation, community dynamics, and ecosystem function. 3. The role of evolution in ecological processes is expected to be largest for traits that change most quickly and for traits that most strongly influence ecological interactions. Understanding this fine-scale interplay of ecological and evolutionary factors will require a new class of eco-evolutionary dynamic modelling. 4. Contemporary evolution occurs in a wide diversity of ecological contexts, but appears to be especially common in response to anthropogenic changes in selection and population structure. Evolutionary biology may thus offer substantial insight to many conservation issues arising from global change. 5. Recent studies suggest that fluctuating selection and associated periods of contemporary evolution are the norm rather than exception throughout the history of life on earth. The consequences of contemporary evolution for population dynamics and ecological interactions are likely ubiquitous in time and space.},

Phylogenetic inference with an alignment of 11,039 amino-acid positions per genome indicates that this information is sufficient--but just rarely so--to identify the rooted nine-taxon topology. We mapped the process of gene loss from chloroplast genomes across the inferred tree and found that, surprisingly, independent parallel gene losses in multiple lineages outnumber phylogenetically unique losses by more that 4:1. We identified homologues of 44 different plastid-encoded proteins as functional nuclear genes of chloroplast origin, providing evidence for endosymbiotic gene transfer to the nucleus in plants.},

Predicting mortality across species is crucial for assessing the effects of climate extremes on forest community biodiversity, composition, and carbon sequestration. However, the physiological traits associated with elevated risk of mortality in diverse ecosystems remain unknown, although these traits could greatly improve understanding and prediction of tree mortality in forests. We performed a meta-analysis on species' mortality rates across 475 species from 33 studies around the globe to assess which traits determine a species' mortality risk. We found that species-specific mortality anomalies from community mortality rate in a given drought were associated with plant hydraulic traits. Across all species, mortality was best predicted by a low hydraulic safety margin-the difference between typical minimum xylem water potential and that causing xylem dysfunction-and xylem vulnerability to embolism. Angiosperms and gymnosperms experienced roughly equal mortality risks. Our results provide broad support for the hypothesis that hydraulic traits capture key mechanisms determining tree death and highlight that physiological traits can improve vegetation model prediction of tree mortality during climate extremes.},

We demonstrate the method with simulation tests that accurately recover parameters relating to the mode of speciation and source-sink dynamics.

Relative to other genera of Lemnaceae, Wolffiella has a restricted range, with species distributed in warm temperate to tropical areas of Africa and the Americas, with only one species,, occurring in both areas. Sequence data from coding (rbcL and matK) and non-coding (trnK and rpl16 introns) regions of cpDNA were analyzed phylogenetically to resolve relationships within Wolffiella, and these results were compared to earlier allozyme and morphological studies. Allozymes, cpDNA and morphology all supported the recognition of three sections. Relationships among species were similar in most respects between the allozyme and cpDNA trees, as well as among the different plastid partitions. In Wolffiella, both non-synonymous and synonymous substitutions were greater in matK than in rbcL, as observed in other taxa. The synonymous substitution rate in matK was similar to the substitution rate of the non-coding regions. All partitions, including coding regions, exhibited some homoplasy. Biogeographical reconstructions from a combination of cpDNA partitions indicated that Wolffielia originated in Africa with early movement to and radiation in the Americas. The one species found in both Africa and the Americas, W.welwitschii, likely originated in the Americas and subsequently dispersed to Africa. Using the SOWH test, the cpDNA data could reject two alternative biogeographical hypotheses suggested from analyses of-morphological and allozyme data. The present distribution of Wolffiella can be explained by two major dispersal events and this contrasts with the more complex species distributions in other Lemnaceae genera. Limited dispersal in Wolffiella relative to other Lemnaceae genera may be due to more recent origins of species, lower dispersibility and poorer colonizing ability.

abstract = {In contrast to competing explanations of species-area relationships (SARs), neutral theory is dynamic, meaning that it should explain patterns in both space and time. However, most empirical tests of neutral theory have. relied on snapshots, such as comparisons of observed and simulated SARs observed at one point in time. I used 35 years of data from permanent plots in Kansas grasslands to test the ability of strict and modified neutral models to reproduce observed species-area and species-time relationships (STRs). Holding species density to observed values, the models could generate realistic SARs or STRs, but not both simultaneously. Parameter combinations that simulated realistic STRs led to SARs with extremely steep slopes. To examine the consequences of relaxing neutrality, I incorporated plant functional types into the model. More realistic dominance produced only limited improvement in the simulated results, and indicates that the models' primary flaw is their failure to reproduce rapid but spatially correlated changes in species composition. In these grasslands, characterized by large interannual variation in resources and many short-lived species, functional differences among species play a strong role in driving macroscopic patterns. The results emphasize the need to test neutral models, and other dynamic community models, with spatiotemporal data.},

An inescapable consequence for most living organisms is great changes in their distribution, which are expressed differently in boreal, temperate and tropical zones. Such range changes can be expected to have genetic consequences, and the advent of DNA technology provides most suitable markers to examine these. Several good data sets are now available, which provide tests of expectations, insights into species colonization and unexpected genetic subdivision and mixture of species. The genetic structure of human populations may be viewed in the same context. The present genetic structure of populations, species and communities has been mainly formed by Quaternary ice ages, and genetic, fossil and physical data combined can greatly help our understanding of how organisms were so affected.},

abstract = {Many evolutionary processes can lead to a change in the correlation between continuous characters over time or on different branches of a phylogenetic tree. Shifts in genetic or functional constraint, in the selective regime, or in some combination thereof can influence both the evolution of continuous traits and their relation to each other. These changes can often be mapped on a phylogenetic tree to examine their influence on multivariate phenotypic diversification. We propose a new likelihood method to fit multiple evolutionary rate matrices (also called evolutionary variance-covariance matrices) to species data for two or more continuous characters and a phylogeny. The evolutionary rate matrix is a matrix containing the evolutionary rates for individual characters on its diagonal, and the covariances between characters (of which the evolutionary correlations are a function) elsewhere. To illustrate our approach, we apply the method to an empirical dataset consisting of two features of feeding morphology sampled from 28 centrarchid fish species, as well as to data generated via phylogenetic numerical simulations. We find that the method has appropriate type I error, power, and parameter estimation. The approach presented herein is the first to allow for the explicit testing of how and when the evolutionary covariances between characters have changed in the history of a group.},

abstract = {Coastal morphologic features associated with past shoreline transgressions and sea-level highstands can provide insight into the rates and processes associated with coastal response to the modern global rise in sea level. Along the eastern and southern Brazilian coasts of South America, 6000 years of sea-level fall have preserved late-stage transgressive and sea-level highstand features 1-4 m above present mean sea level and several kilometers landward of modern shorelines. GPS with real-time kinematics data, ground-penetrating radar, stratigraphy, and radiocarbon dating within a 2-3-km-wide river-associated strandplain in central Santa Catarina (southern Brazil) uncovered a diverse set of late-stage transgressive and highstand deposits. Here, the highstand took the forms of (1) an exposed bedrock coast in areas of high wave energy and low sediment supply; (2) a 3.8-m-high transgressive barrier ridge where landward barrier migration was prohibited by the presence of shallow bedrock; and (3) a complete barrier-island complex containing a 5.2-m-high barrier ridge, wash-over deposits, a paleo-inlet, and a backbarrier lowland, formed in a protected cove with ample sediment supply from small local streams and the erosion of upland sediments. Similar signatures of the mid-Holocene highstand can be traced across all coastal Brazilian states. This study presents the first complete compilation of the diversity of these sedimentary sequences. They are broadly classified here as exposed bedrock coasts (type A), back barrier deposits (type B), transgressive barrier ridges (type C), and barrier-island complexes (type D), according to localized conditions of upland migration potential, wave exposure, and sediment supply. These Brazilian systems present a paradigm for understanding future coastal response to climate change and accelerated sea-level rise: the recognition of a minimum threshold sea-level-rise rate of similar to 2 mm yr(-1) above which transgression proceeded too rapidly for the formation of these stable accretionary shoreline features demonstrates the nonlinearity of coastal response to sea-level change, and the site specificity of conditions associated with the formation of each highstand deposit type, even within a single small embayment, demonstrates the non-uniformity of that response.},

abstract = {A number of studies at large scales have pointed out that abiotic factors and recolonization dynamics appear to be more important than biotic interactions in structuring stream-fish assemblages. In contrast, experimental and field studies at small scales show the importance of competition among stream fishes. However, given the highly variable nature of stream systems over time, competition may not be intense enough to generate large-scale complementary distributions via competitive exclusion. Complementary distribution is a recurrent pattern observed in fish communities across stream gradients, though it is not clear which instances of this pattern are due to competitive interactions and which to individual species' requirements. In this study, I introduce a series of null models developed to provide a more robust evaluation of species associations by facilitating the distinction between different processes that may shape species distributions and community assembly. These null models were applied to test whether conspicuous patterns in species co-occurrences are more consistent with their differences in habitat use, morphological features and/or phylogenetic constraints, or with species interactions in fish communities in the streams of a watershed in eastern Brazil. I concluded that patterns in species co-occurrences within the studied system are driven by common species-habitat relationships and species interactions may not play a significant role in structuring these communities. I suggest that large-scale studies, where adequate designs and robust analytical tools are applied, can contribute substantially to understanding the importance of different types of processes in structuring stream-fish communities.},

abstract = {The response of tree growth to a change in temperature may differ in predictable ways. Trees with conservative growth strategies may have little ability to respond to a changing climate. In addition, high latitude and altitude tree growth may be temperature-limited and thus benefit from some degree of warming, as opposed to warm-adapted species. Using data from 63 studies, we examined whether trees from different functional groups and thermal niches differed in their growth response to a change in growth temperature. We also investigated whether responses predicted for a change in growth temperature (both reduced and elevated) were similar for increased temperatures by repeating the analysis on the subset of raised temperature data to confirm the validity of our results for use in a climate-warming scenario. Using both the temperature-change response and the warming response, we found that elevated temperatures enhanced growth (measured as shoot height, stem diameter and biomass) in deciduous species more than in evergreen trees. Tropical species were indeed more susceptible to warming-induced growth declines than temperate or boreal trees in both analyses. More carbon may be available to allocate to growth at high temperatures because respiration acclimated more strongly than photosynthesis, increasing carbon assimilation but moderating carbon losses. Trees that developed at elevated temperatures did not simply accelerate growth but followed different developmental trajectories than unwarmed trees, allocating more biomass to leaves and less to roots and growing taller for a given stem diameter. While there were insufficient data to analyze trends for particular species, we generated equations to describe general trends in tree growth to temperature changes and to warming for use at large spatial scales or where data are lacking. We discuss the implications of these results in the context of a changing climate and highlight the areas of greatest uncertainty regarding temperature and tree growth where future research is needed.},

Here we present a new calibration and validation of PROSPECT that separates plant pigment contributions to the visible spectrum using several comprehensive datasets containing hundreds of leaves collected in a wide range of ecosystem types. These data include leaf biochemical (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, carotenoids, water, and dry matter) and optical properties (directional-hemispherical reflectance and transmittance measured from 400 nm to 2450 nm). We first provide distinct in vivo specific absorption coefficients for each biochemical constituent and determine an average refractive index of the leaf interior. Then we invert the model on independent datasets to check the prediction of the biochemical content of intact leaves. The main result of this study is that the new chlorophyll and carotenoid specific absorption coefficients agree well with available in vitro absorption spectra, and that the new refractive index displays interesting spectral features in the visible, in accordance with physical principles. Moreover, we improve the chlorophyll estimation (RMSE = 9 $\mu$g/cm2) and obtain very encouraging results with carotenoids (RMSE = 3 $\mu$g/cm2). Reconstruction of reflectance and transmittance in the 400-2450 nm wavelength domain using PROSPECT is also excellent, with small errors and low to negligible biases.

We utilize this general framework and data from three tropical forests to show that rare species have a weak influence on distance-decay curves, and that overall similarity and rates of decay are primarily influenced by species abundances and population aggregation respectively. We illustrate the utility of the framework by deriving an exact analytical expression of the distance-decay relationship when population aggregation is characterized by the Poisson Cluster Process.

abstract = {We describe extensions to the method of Pritchard et al. for inferring population structure from multilocus genotype data. Most importantly, we develop methods that allow for linkage between loci. The new model accounts for the correlations between linked loci that arise in admixed populations ("admixture linkage disequilibium"). This modification has several advantages, allowing (1) detection of admixture events farther back into the past, (2) inference of the population of origin of chromosomal regions, and (3) more accurate estimates of statistical uncertainty when linked loci are used. It is also of potential use for admixture mapping. In addition, we describe a new prior model for the allele frequencies within each population, which allows identification of subtle population subdivisions that were not detectable using the existing method. We present results applying the new methods to study admixture in African-Americans, recombination in Helicobacter pylori, and drift in populations of Drosophila melanogaster. The methods are implemented in a program, structure, version 2.0, which is available at http://pritch.bsd.uchicago.edu.},

Technical specificities of the AFLP procedure have been well documented over the years, but there is on the contrary little or scattered information about the statistical analysis of AFLPs. In this review, we describe the various methods available to handle AFLP data, focusing on four research topics at the population or individual level of analysis: (i) assessment of genetic diversity; (ii) identification of population structure; (iii) identification of hybrid individuals; and (iv) detection of markers associated with phenotypes. Two kinds of analysis methods can be distinguished, depending on whether they are based on the direct study of band presences or absences in AFLP profiles ('band-based' methods), or on allelic frequencies estimated at each locus from these profiles ('allele frequency-based' methods). We investigate the characteristics and limitations of these statistical tools; finally, we appeal for a wider adoption of methodologies borrowed from other research fields, like for example those especially designed to deal with binary data.},

abstract = {Earlier work on the submergence-tolerant species Rumex palustris revealed that leaf anatomical and morphological changes induced by submergence enhance underwater gas exchange considerably. Here, the hypothesis is tested that these plastic responses are typical properties of submergence-tolerant species. Submergence-induced plasticity in leaf mass area (LMA) and leaf, cell wall and cuticle thickness was investigated in nine plant species differing considerably in tolerance to complete submergence. The functionality of the responses for underwater gas exchange was evaluated by recording oxygen partial pressures inside the petioles when plants were submerged. Acclimation to submergence resulted in a decrease in all leaf parameters, including cuticle thickness, in all species irrespective of flooding tolerance. Consequently, internal oxygen partial pressures (pO(2)) increased significantly in all species until values were close to air saturation. Only in nonacclimated leaves in darkness did intolerant species have a significantly lower pO(2) than tolerant species. These results suggest that submergence-induced leaf plasticity, albeit a prerequisite for underwater survival, does not discriminate tolerant from intolerant species. It is hypothesized that these plastic leaf responses may be induced in all species by several signals present during submergence; for example, low LMA may be a response to low photosynthate concentrations and a thin cuticle may be a response to high relative humidity.},

abstract = {Accurate differentiation between tropical forest and savannah ecosystems in the fossil pollen record is hampered by the combination of: i) poor taxonomic resolution in pollen identification, and ii) the high species diversity of many lowland tropical families, i.e. with many different growth forms living in numerous environmental settings. These barriers to interpreting the fossil record hinder our understanding of the past distributions of different Neotropical ecosystems and consequently cloud our knowledge of past climatic, biodiversity and carbon storage patterns. Modern pollen studies facilitate an improved understanding of how ecosystems are represented by the pollen their plants produce and therefore aid interpretation of fossil pollen records. To understand how to differentiate ecosystems palynologically, it is essential that a consistent sampling method is used across ecosystems. However, to date, modern pollen studies from tropical South America have employed a variety of methodologies (e.g. pollen traps, moss polsters, soil samples). In this paper, we present the first modern pollen study from the Neotropics to examine the modern pollen rain from moist evergreen tropical forest (METF), semi-deciduous dry tropical forest (SDTF) and wooded savannah (cerrad{\~{a}}o) using a consistent sampling methodology (pollen traps). Pollen rain was sampled annually in September for the years 1999-2001 from within permanent vegetation study plots in, or near, the Noel Kempff Mercado National Park (NKMNP), Bolivia. Comparison of the modern pollen rain within these plots with detailed floristic inventories allowed estimates of the relative pollen productivity and dispersal for individual taxa to be made ({\%} pollen/{\%} vegetation or 'p/v'). The applicability of these data to interpreting fossil records from lake sediments was then explored by comparison with pollen assemblages obtained from five lake surface samples. Pollen productivity is demonstrated to vary inter-annually and conforms to a consistent hierarchy for any given year: METF {\textgreater} SDTF {\textgreater} cerrad{\~{a}}o. This suggests an association between pollen productivity and basic structural characteristics of the ecosystem, i.e. closed canopy vs. open canopy vs. savannah. Comparison of modern pollen and vegetation revealed that some important floristic elements were completely absent from the pollen: Qualea and Erisma (METF), Bauhinia, Simira and Guazuma (SDTF), and Pouteria and Caryocar (cerrad{\~{a}}o). Anadenanthera was found to be abundant in both the pollen and flora of SDTF (p/v = 3.6), while Poaceae was relatively poorly represented in cerrad{\~{a}}o (0.2). Moraceae, Cecropia and Schefflera were found to be over-represented palynologically in all ecosystems. Overall, the data demonstrated that no one taxon could be used as a definitive indicator of any of the ecosystems. Instead, associations of taxa were found to be important: METF = Moraceae ({\textgreater} 40{\%}), Cecropia, Hyeronima, Celtis; SDTF = Anadenanthera, Apuleia, Ferdinandusa and non-arboreal Asteraceae, Bromeliaceae, Piper and fern spores; cerrad{\~{a}}o = Poaceae, Myrtaceae, Borreria, Solanum plus Asteraceae and fern spores. Interpretation of Poaceae pollen was highlighted as problematic, with relatively low abundance in the cerrad{\~{a}}o ({\textless} 20{\%}) in comparison to high abundance in lake environments (c. 30-50{\%}). Re-examination of fossil pollen records from NKMNP revealed that modern vegetation associations were only established in the last few thousand years. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Maherali2004,
abstract = {The ability of plants to supply water to their leaves is intimately associated with survival. Water supply to leaves depends on maintaining an intact water column in the xylem from the roots to shoots. Because this hydraulic pathway is under tension, it is vulnerable to breakage through the induction of air emboli (cavitation). Although the physiological benefit of resistance to water-stress-induced xylem cavitation for desiccation tolerance is clear, there is considerable interspecific variation within and across climates. To understand the adaptive significance of this variation and the potential trade-off with water transport, we compiled a database of 167 species from 50 seed plant families and examined relationships among resistance to xylem cavitation, water transport capacity (as determined by the specific conductivity of xylem [Ks]), and climate. Relationships were evaluated using standard cross-species correlations (r). Because inferences about the adaptive significance of these correlations can be biased by the potential similarity of closely related species, we also analyzed our data using phylogenetically independent contrast correlations (PIC) calculated over a range of alternate seed plant phylogenies. Resistance to cavitation, expressed as the xylem tension at which 50{\%} of hydraulic conductivity was lost ($\Psi$50), ranged from -0.18 to -9.9 MPa for angiosperms and from -1.5 to -14.1 MPa for conifers. Conifers were most resistant to cavitation, with mean $\Psi$50 80{\%} more negative than angiosperms. In contrast, Ks was 270{\%} higher in angiosperms than conifers. Across all species, cavitation resistance increased with decreasing mean annual precipitation. However, significant phylogenetically independent contrast correlations between $\Psi$50 and annual precipitation were found within the evergreen angiosperms and conifers but not in the deciduous angiosperms. Thus, the adaptive significance of increased resistance to cavitation as a mechanism of drought tolerance may be of primary importance in evergreen angiosperms and conifers. In contrast, analysis of independent contrasts indicated that Ks increased with decreasing rainfall in deciduous angiosperms, whereas there was no association between Ks and water availability for evergreen angiosperms and conifers. These results suggest that the evolution of increased Ks may be a critical adaptation to water limitation in deciduous angiosperms. Although there was a significant cross-species correlation between $\Psi$50 and Ks, this relationship was not supported by the independent contrast correlation, suggesting that the evolutionary basis for a trade-off between cavitation resistance and water transport capacity is weak.},

abstract = {Current estimates of diversifying positive selection rely on first having an accurate multiple sequence alignment. Simulation studies have shown that under biologically plausible conditions, relying on a single estimate of the alignment from commonly used alignment software can lead to unacceptably high false-positive rates in detecting diversifying positive selection. We present a novel statistical method that eliminates excess false positives resulting from alignment error by jointly estimating the degree of positive selection and the alignment under an evolutionary model. Our model treats both substitutions and insertions/deletions as sequence changes on a tree and allows site heterogeneity in the substitution process. We conduct inference starting from unaligned sequence data by integrating over all alignments. This approach naturally accounts for ambiguous alignments without requiring ambiguously aligned sites to be identified and removed prior to analysis. We take a Bayesian approach and conduct inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo to integrate over all alignments on a fixed evolutionary tree topology. We introduce a Bayesian version of the branch-site test and assess the evidence for positive selection using Bayes factors. We compare two models of differing dimensionality using a simple alternative to reversible-jump methods. We also describe a more accurate method of estimating the Bayes factor using Rao-Blackwellization. We then show using simulated data that jointly estimating the alignment and the presence of positive selection solves the problem with excessive false positives from erroneous alignments and has nearly the same power to detect positive selection as when the true alignment is known. We also show that samples taken from the posterior alignment distribution using the software BAli-Phy have substantially lower alignment error compared with MUSCLE, MAFFT, PRANK, and FSA alignments.},

abstract = {The Brazilian Atlantic rainforest consists of a typical tropical rainforest on mountain slopes, and stands out as a biodiversity hotspot for its high species richness and high level of species endemism. This forest is bordered by plant communities with lower species diversity, due mostly to more extreme environmental conditions than those found in the mesic rainforest. Between the mountain slopes and the sea, the coastal plains have swamp forests, dry semi-deciduous forests and open thicket vegetation on marine sand deposits. At the other extreme, on top of the mountains ({\textgreater}2000 m a.s.l.), the rainforest is substituted by high altitude fields and open thicket vegetation on rocky outcrops. Thus, the plant communities that are marginal to the rainforest are subjected either to flooding, drought, oceanicity or cold winter temperatures. It was found that positive interactions among plants play an important role in the structuring and functioning of a swamp forest, a coastal sandy vegetation and a cold, high altitude vegetation in the state of Rio de Janeiro. Moreover, only a few species seem to adopt this positive role and, therefore, the functioning of these entire systems may rely on them. Curiously, these nurse plants are often epiphytes in the rainforest, and at the study sites are typically terrestrial. Many exhibit crassulacean acid metabolism. Conservation initiatives must treat the Atlantic coastal vegetation as a complex rather than a rainforest alone.},

@article{Kawecki2008,
abstract = {If gene flow occurs through both sexes but only females contribute to population growth, adaptation to marginal (sink) habitats should be differentially affected by male versus female dispersal. Here I address this problem with two models. First, I consider the fate of a rare allele that improves fitness in the marginal habitat but reduces fitness in the core (source) habitat. Then I study the evolution of a polygenic character mediating a trade-off in fitness between the habitats. Both approaches led to qualitatively similar predictions. The effect of a difference in the dispersal rate between the sexes depends on the degree to which immigration from the core habitat boosts the reproductive output from the marginal habitat. This boost is slight if the marginal habitat is able to sustain well a population without immigration. In that case, both female- and male-biased dispersal is more favorable for adaptation to marginal habitats than equal dispersal of both sexes (assuming that the dispersal rate averaged over the sexes is kept constant). In contrast, if the marginal habitat is an absolute sink unable to sustain a population without immigration, the conditions for adaptation to that habitat are least favorable under highly male-biased dispersal and most favorable under highly female-biased dispersal. Under some circumstances, high average (male+female) dispersal is more favorable than low dispersal. Thus, gene flow should not be seen solely as thwarting adaptation to marginal habitats. The results are interpreted in terms of how male and female dispersal affects the relative rate of gene flow from the source to the sink habitat and in the opposite direction. This study predicts that ecological niches of taxa with female-biased dispersal should tend to be broader and more evolutionarily flexible.},

abstract = {Many molecular phylogenies show longer root-to-tip path lengths in species-rich groups, encouraging hypotheses linking cladogenesis with accelerated molecular evolution. However, the pattern can also be caused by an artifact called the node density effect (NDE): this effect occurs when the method used to reconstruct a tree underestimates multiple hits that would have been revealed by extra nodes, leading to longer root-to-tip path lengths in clades with more terminal taxa. Here we use a twofold approach to demonstrate that maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods also suffer from the NDE known to affect parsimony. First, simulations deliberately mismatching the simulation and reconstruction models show that the greater the model disparity, the greater the gap between actual and reconstructed tree lengths, and the greater the NDE. Second, taxon sampling manipulation with empirical data shows that NDE can still be present when using optimized models: across 12 datasets, 70 out of 109 sister path comparisons showed significant evidence of NDE. Unless the model fairly accurately reconstructs the real tree length-and given the complexity of real sequence evolution this may be uncommon -- it will consistently produce a node density artifact. At commonly encountered divergence levels, a 10{\%} underestimation of tree length results in {\textgreater} or = 80{\%} of simulated phylogenies showing a positive NDE. Bayesian trees have a slight but consistently stronger effect. This pervasive methodological artifact increases apparent rate heterogeneity, and can compromise investigations of factors influencing molecular evolutionary rate that use path lengths in topologically asymmetric trees.},

abstract = {The eastern Asian and eastern North American disjunction in Juglans offers an opportunity to estimate the time since divergence of the Eurasian and American lineages and to compare it with paleobotanical evidence. Five chloroplast DNA noncoding spacer (NCS) sequences: trnT−trnF, psbA−trnH, atpB−rbcL, trnV-16S rRNA, and trnS-trnfM and data from earlier studies (matK, ITS, and nuclear RFLP) were used to reconstruct phylogeny and to estimate the divergence time of major lineages. Seventeen taxa from four sections of Juglans and two outgroup taxa, Pterocarya stenoptera and Carya illinoiensis were includ- ed. NCS data was congruent only with matK data. Both maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML) cladograms were concordant at the sectional level and revealed three well-supported monophyletic clades corresponding to sections Juglans, Cardiocaryon,and Rhysocaryon in both NCS and combined analyses. The single extant American butternut, Juglans cinerea was placed within the poorly resolved, but well-supported Rhysocaryon. Placement of taxa within Rhysocaryon and Cardiocaryon were inconsistent between NCS and combined analyses. Overall, the results suggest that: (1) the NCS sequence divergence observed within and between sections of Juglans is low and the addition of matK data only marginally improved resolution within Rhysocaryon; (2) the early divergence of section Juglans in both MP and ML analyses of NCS and combined data implies its ancient origin in contrast to fossil evidence, which suggests the earliest divergence of sections Rhysocaryon and Cardio- caryon; and (3) the extant taxa may not hold the footprints to unravel the evolutionary history of the genus.

abstract = {With increasing concern about the ecological consequences of global climate change, there has been renewed interest in understanding the processes that determine species range limits. We tested a long-hypothesized trade-off between freezing tolerance and growth rate that is often used to explain species range limits. We grew 24 willow and poplar species (family Salicaceae) collected from across North America in a greenhouse common garden under two climate treatments. Maximum entropy models were used to describe species distributions and to estimate species-specific climate parameters. A range of traits related to freezing tolerance, including senescence, budburst, and susceptibility to different temperature minima during and after acclimation were measured. As predicted, species from colder climates exhibited higher freezing tolerance and slower growth rates than species from warmer climates under certain environmental conditions. However, the average relative growth rate (millimeters per meter per day) of northern species markedly increased when a subset of species was grown under a long summer day length (20.5 h), indicating that genetically based day-length cues are required for growth regulation in these species. We conclude that the observed relationship between freezing tolerance and growth rate is not driven by differences in species' intrinsic growth capacity but by differences in the environmental cues that trigger growth. We propose that the coordinated evolution of freezing tolerance and growth phenology could be important in circumscribing willow and poplar range limits and may have important implications for species' current and future distributions.},

abstract = {The tree flora of southeastern Brazilian Atlantic forests was investigated according to two main aspects: (a) the variations in floristic composition of both rain and semi-deciduous forests were analyzed in terms of geographic and climatic variables by performing multivariate analyses on 125 existing floristic checklists; and (b) the links of both rain and semi- deciduous forests to Amazonian forests and Cerrados (woody savanna) were assessed. All analyses were performed at the species, genus, and family levels. The information obtained for the 125 forest areas was organized into an environmental database containing geographic and climatic records, and a floristic database containing binary presence records for 2532 species, 520 genera, and 106 families. Canonical correspondence analyses (CCA) were utilized to assess the relationship between geographic and climatic variables, and tree flora composition. Venn diagrams and cluster analyses were used to assess the floristic links to Amazonian forests and Cerrados. The following patterns were detected at all three taxonomic levels: (a) the differentiation between rain and semi-deciduous forests is floristically consistent and strongly correlated with rainfall regime, although transitions may be abrupt to gradual; (b) a north–south differentiation exists for both rain and semi-deciduous forests, probably caused by variations in both temperature and rainfall regime; (c) The flora of semi- deciduous forests also changes with increasing distance from the ocean and the associated increasing rainfall seasonality; and (d) elevation and associated temperatures are strongly correlated with the internal differentiation of both rain and semi-deciduous forests. To a considerable extent, the tree flora of semi-deciduous forests is a subset of the rain forest flora, probably extracting species that are able to cope with a longer dry season. There is greater floristic similarity at the species level between Atlantic rain and semi-deciduous forests than between any of these and either Amazonian rain forests or Cerrados. Nevertheless, semi-deciduous forests and Cerrados show stronger links, particularly at the generic and familial levels. Therefore, there is little floristic ground for viewing Atlantic rain forests as being closer to their Amazonian counterparts than to the adjacent semi-deciduous forests. The most appropriate view of rain and semi- deciduous forests in southeastern Brazil is that of a continuum in tree species distribution.We suggest that the definition of Atlantic forests should be as comprehensive as that of Amazonian forests.

abstract = {A combined parsimony analysis of the species of Phaseolus and closely related New World genera was performed with sequences from the nuclear ribosomal ITS/5.8 S and plastid trnK loci. Species relationships are resolved with high parsimony bootstrap support at all hierarchical levels. All species of Phaseolus, except five enigmatic ones, belong to one of eight clades. These eight clades show some morphological, ecological, or biogeographical distinction, and are informally recognized in a phylogenetic classification. The five enigmatic species, Phaseolus glabellus, P. macrolepis, P. microcarpus, P. oaxacanus, and P. talamancensis are weakly resolved as the sister clade to the Tuerckheimii group. An evolutionary rates analysis that biases for old age estimates suggests that the Phaseolus stem clade is the same age as the New World Phaseolinae crown clade with a maximum age of ca. 8 Ma. The Phaseolus crown is estimated to be no older than ca. 6 Ma, and the average age of the eight well supported crown clades within Phaseolus is ca. 2 Ma. The maximum age estimate of a Late Pliocene to Pleistocene diversification of Phaseolus post-dates the major tectonic activity in Mexico where Phaseolus diversity is centered.},

abstract = {Many tropical forest tree species have broad geographic ranges, and fossil records indicate that population disjunctions in some species were established millions of years ago. Here we relate biogeographic history to patterns of population differentiation, mutational and demographic processes in the widespread rainforest tree Symphonia globulifera using ribosomal (ITS) and chloroplast DNA sequences and nuclear microsatellite (nSSR) loci. Fossil records document sweepstakes dispersal origins of Neotropical S. globulifera populations from Africa during the Miocene. Despite historical long-distance gene flow, nSSR differentiation across 13 populations from Costa Rica, Panama, Ecuador (east and west of Andes) and French Guiana was pronounced (F(ST)= 0.14, R(ST)= 0.39, P {\textless} 0.001) and allele-size mutations contributed significantly (R(ST) {\textgreater} F(ST)) to the divergences between cis- and trans-Andean populations. Both DNA sequence and nSSR data reflect contrasting demographic histories in lower Mesoamerica and Amazonia. Amazon populations show weak phylogeographic structure and deviation from drift-mutation equilibrium indicating recent population expansion. In Mesoamerica, genetic drift was strong and contributed to marked differentiation among populations. The genetic structure of S. globulifera contains fingerprints of drift-dispersal processes and phylogeographic footprints of geological uplifts and sweepstakes dispersal.},

Populations of E. edulis represent important renewable natural resources but are currently under threat from predatory exploitation. Furthermore, because the species is indigenous to the Atlantic Rainforest, which is located in the most economically developed and populated region of Brazil, social and economic pressures have devastated heart-of-palm forests. In order to estimate the partitioning of genetic variation of endangered E. edulis populations, 429 AFLP markers were used to analyse 150 plants representing 11 populations of the species distribution range. Analysis of the genetic structure of populations carried out using analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed moderate genetic variation within populations (57. 4{\%}). Genetic differentiation between populations (FST = 0.426) was positively correlated with geographical distance. These results could be explained by the historical fragmentation of the Atlantic coastal region, together with the life cycle and mating system. The data obtained in this work should have important implications for conservation and future breeding programmes of E. edulis.},

abstract = {Three commonly used molecular dating methods for correction of variable rates (non-parametric rate smoothing, penalized likelihood, and Bayesian rate correction) as well as the assumption of a global molecular clock were tested for sensitivity to taxon sampling. The test dataset of 6854 basepairs for 300 terminals includes a nearly complete sample of the Restio-clade of the African Restionaceae (272 of the 288 species), as well as 26 outgroup species. Of this, nested subsets of 35, 51, 80, 120, 150, and the full 300 species were used. Molecular dating experiments with these datasets showed that all methods are sensitive to undersampling, but that this effect is more severe in analyses that use more extreme rate smoothing. Additionally, the undersampling effect is positively related to distance from the calibration node. The combined effect of undersampling and distance from the calibration node resulted in up to threefold differences in the age estimation of nodes from the same dataset with the same calibration point. We suggest that the most suitable methods are penalized likelihood and Bayesian when a global clock assumption has been rejected, as these methods are more successful at finding optimal levels of smoothing to correct for rate heterogeneity, and are less sensitive to undersampling. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Understanding spatial patterns of species diversity and the distri- butions of individual species is a consuming problem in biogeography and con- servation. The Cape Floristic Region (CFR) of South Africa is a global hotspot of diversity and endemism, and the Protea Atlas Project, with some 60,000 site records across the region, provides an extraordinarily rich data set to analyze bio- diversity patterns. Analysis for the region is developed at the spatial scale of one minute grid-cells (∼ 37, 000 cells total for the region). We report on results for 40 species of a flowering plant family Proteaceae (of about 330 in the CFR) for a defined subregion. Using a Bayesian framework, we develop a two stage, spatially explicit, hierar- chical logistic regression. Stage one models the suitability or potential presence for each species at each cell, given species attributes along with grid cell (site-level) climate, precipitation, topography and geology data using species-level coefficients, and a spatial random effect. The second level of the hierarchy models, for each species, observed presence/absence at a sampling site through a conditional speci- fication of the probability of presence at an arbitrary location in the grid cell given that the location is suitable. Because the atlas data are not evenly distributed across the landscape, grid cells contain variable numbers of sampling localities. Indeed, some grid cells are entirely unsampled; others have been transformed by human intervention (agriculture, urbanization) such that none of the species are there though some may have the potential to be present in the absence of distur- bance. Thus the modeling takes the sampling intensity at each site into account by assuming that the total number of times that a particular species was observed within a site follows a binomial distribution. In fact, a range of models can be examined incorporating different first and second stage specifications. This necessitates model comparison in a misaligned multilevel setting. All models are fitted using MCMC methods. A “best” model is selected. Parameter summaries offer considerable insight. In addition, results are mapped as the model-estimated potential presence for each species across the domain. This probability surface provides an alternative to customary empiri- cal “range of occupancy” displays. Summing yields the predicted species richness over the region. Summaries of the posterior for each environmental coefficient show which variables are most important in explaining species presence. Other biodi- versity measures emerge as model unknowns. A considerable range of inference is available. We illustrate with only a portion of the analyses we have conducted, noting that these initial results describe biogeographical patterns over the modeled region remarkably well.},

These limits arise from complex interactions among ecology and dispersal ability of species and the physical environment, but many of the underlying traits can be conserved among related species and clades. Thus, the range limits of species are likely to be influenced by their macroevolutionary history. Using palaeontological and biogeographic data for marine bivalves, we find that the range limits of genera are significantly related to their constituent species richness, but the effects of age are weak and inconsistent. In addition, we find a significant phylogenetic signal in the range limits at both genus and family levels, although the strength of this effect shows interoceanic variation. This phylogenetic conservatism of range limits gives rise to an evolutionary pattern where wide-ranging lineages have clusters of species within the biogeographic provinces, with a few extending across major boundaries.},

Given recent methodological improvements in estimating divergence times, refined understanding of relationships among major angiosperm lineages, and the immense interest in using large angiosperm phylogenies to investigate questions in ecology and comparative biology, new estimates of the ages of the major clades are badly needed. Improved estimations of divergence times will concomitantly improve our understanding of both the evolutionary history of the angiosperms and the patterns and processes that have led to this highly diverse clade. •$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We simultaneously estimated the age of the angiosperms and the divergence times of key angiosperm lineages, using 36 calibration points for 567 taxa and a "relaxed clock" methodology that does not assume any correlation between rates, thus allowing for lineage-specific rate heterogeneity. •$\backslash$n$\backslash$nKEY RESULTS: Based on the analysis for which we set fossils to fit lognormal priors, we obtained an estimated age of the angiosperms of 167-199 Ma and the following age estimates for major angiosperm clades: Mesangiospermae (139-156 Ma); Gunneridae (109-139 Ma); Rosidae (108-121 Ma); Asteridae (101-119 Ma). •$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: With the exception of the age of the angiosperms themselves, these age estimates are generally younger than other recent molecular estimates and very close to dates inferred from the fossil record. We also provide dates for all major angiosperm clades (including 45 orders and 335 families [208 stem group age only, 127 both stem and crown group ages], sensu APG III). Our analyses provide a new comprehensive source of reference dates for major angiosperm clades that we hope will be of broad utility.},

Recent technological advances for assessing optical properties of plants offer opportunities to detect functional traits of organisms and differentiate levels of biological organization across the tree of life. Here we connect leaf-level full range spectral data (400-2400 nm) of leaves to the hierarchical organization of plant diversity within the oak genus (Quercus) using field and greenhouse experiments in which environmental factors and plant age are controlled. We show that spectral data significantly differentiate populations within a species and that spectral similarity is significantly associated with phylogenetic similarity among species. We further show that hyperspectral information allows more accurate classification of taxa than spectrally-derived traits, which by definition are of lower dimensionality. Finally, model accuracy increases at higher levels in the hierarchical organization of plant diversity, such that we are able to better distinguish clades than species or populations. This pattern supports an evolutionary explanation for the degree of optical differentiation among plants and demonstrates potential for remote detection of genetic and phylogenetic diversity.},

Using a metacommunity simulation incorporating quantitative models of trait evolution and community assembly, I assessed the performance of different tests that have been used to measure community phylogenetic structure. All tests were sensitive to the relative phylogenetic signal in species metacommunity abundances and traits; methods that were most sensitive to the effects of niche-based processes on community structure were also more likely to find non-random patterns of community phylogenetic structure under dispersal assembly. When used with a null model that maintained species occurrence frequency in random communities, several metrics could detect niche-based assembly when there was strong phylogenetic signal in species traits, when multiple traits were involved in community assembly, and in the presence of environmental heterogeneity. Interpretations of the causes of community phylogenetic structure should be modified to account for the influence of dispersal.},

Penalized likelihood rate smoothing was performed on sets of Bayesian likelihood trees generated with the AIC-selected GTR+ Gamma +I substitution model. Unequivocal legume fossils dating from the Recent continuously back to about 56 million years ago were used to fix the family stem clade at 60 million years (Ma), and at 1-Ma intervals back to 70 Ma. Specific fossils that showed distinctive combinations of apomorphic traits were used to constrain the minimum age of 12 specific internal nodes. These constraints were placed on stem rather than respective crown clades in order to bias for younger age estimates. Regardless, the mean age of the legume crown clade differs by only 1.0 to 2.5 Ma from the fixed age of the legume stem clade. Additionally, the oldest caesalpinioid, mimosoid, and papilionoid crown clades show approximately the same age range of 39 to 59 Ma. These findings all point to a rapid family-wide diversification, and predict few if any legume fossils prior to the Cenozoic. The range of the matK substitution rate, 2.1-24.6 x 10(-10) substitutions per site per year, is higher than that of rbcL, 1.6- 8.6 x 10(-10), and is accompanied by more uniform rate variation among codon positions. The matK and rbcL substitution rates are highly correlated across the legume family. For example, both loci have the slowest substitution rates among the mimosoids and the fastest rates among the millettioid legumes. This explains why groups such as the millettioids are amenable to species-level phylogenetic analysis with these loci, whereas other legume groups are not.},

abstract = {The angiosperm order Malpighiales includes {\~{}}16,000 species and constitutes up to 40{\%} of the understory tree diversity in tropical rain forests. Despite remarkable progress in angiosperm systematics during the last 20 y, relationships within Malpighiales remain poorly resolved, possibly owing to its rapid rise during the mid-Cretaceous. Using phylogenomic approaches, including analyses of 82 plastid genes from 58 species, we identified 12 additional clades in Malpighiales and substantially increased resolution along the backbone. This greatly improved phylogeny revealed a dynamic history of shifts in net diversification rates across Malpighiales, with bursts of diversification noted in the Barbados cherries (Malpighiaceae), cocas (Erythroxylaceae), and passion flowers (Passifloraceae). We found that commonly used a priori approaches for partitioning concatenated data in maximum likelihood analyses, by gene or by codon position, performed poorly relative to the use of partitions identified a posteriori using a Bayesian mixture model. We also found better branch support in trees inferred from a taxon-rich, data-sparse matrix, which deeply sampled only the phylogenetically critical placeholders, than in trees inferred from a taxon-sparse matrix with little missing data. Although this matrix has more missing data, our a posteriori partitioning strategy reduced the possibility of producing multiple distinct but equally optimal topologies and increased phylogenetic decisiveness, compared with the strategy of partitioning by gene. These approaches are likely to help improve phylogenetic resolution in other poorly resolved major clades of angiosperms and to be more broadly useful in studies across the Tree of Life.},

abstract = {Plants offer excellent models to investigate how gene flow shapes the organization of genetic diversity. Their three genomes can have different modes of transmission and will hence experience varying levels of gene flow. We have compiled studies of genetic structure based on chloroplast DNA (cpDNA), mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear markers in seed plants. Based on a data set of 183 species belonging to 103 genera and 52 families, we show that the precision of estimates of genetic differentiation (G(ST)) used to infer gene flow is mostly constrained by the sampling of populations. Mode of inheritance appears to have a major effect on G(ST). Maternally inherited genomes experience considerably more subdivision (median value of 0.67) than paternally or biparentally inherited genomes (approximately 0.10). G(ST) at cpDNA and mtDNA markers covary narrowly when both genomes are maternally inherited, whereas G(ST) at paternally and biparentally inherited markers also covary positively but more loosely and G(ST) at maternally inherited markers are largely independent of values based on nuclear markers. A model-based gross estimate suggests that, at the rangewide scale, historical levels of pollen flow are generally at least an order of magnitude larger than levels of seed flow (median of the pollen-to-seed migration ratio: 17) and that pollen and seed gene flow vary independently across species. Finally, we show that measures of subdivision that take into account the degree of similarity between haplotypes (N(ST) or R(ST)) make better use of the information inherent in haplotype data than standard measures based on allele frequencies only.},

abstract = {* A central aim of forest ecologists is to quantify the relative importance of different community assembly mechanisms in tropical and subtropical tree communities. Recent work in this field has focused on the importance of functional trait similarity and abiotic filtering. While important, none of this work has simultaneously: linked these trait dispersion patterns to the underlying abiotic environment, considered dispersal limitation and quantified the degree to which patterns of trait dispersion may be explained simply by shared ancestry. * Here we use data from a subtropical Chinese forest to accomplish this goal. We first examine the trait dispersion (leaf area, specific leaf area, seed mass, wood density, maximum height and five traits together) on local scales by comparing the observed trait dispersion pattern to that expected from a null model. Then we use a variance partitioning approach to examine the degree to which spatial proximity, environmental similarity or the phylogenetic dispersion of the species determine the observed trait dispersion. * The results show that, on local scales, trait dispersion is often non-randomly filtered. Further the widespread trait clustering observed is largely explained by the environment and space, while the phylogenetic dispersion of species in a sample explains relatively little. This result further underscores that inferring an assembly mechanism from a pattern of phylogenetic dispersion is tenuous. * The work is important in that it is the first to partition the variation in tree trait diversity into its spatial, environmental and phylogenetic components and that it demonstrates that functional trait data often lack enough phylogenetic signal on local scales to confidently link patterns of trait and phylogenetic dispersion. Ultimately, the findings suggest a strong role for abiotic filtering and dispersal limitation during community assembly on local spatial scales and that shared evolutionary history plays a relatively small role.},

abstract = {The dominant protocol to study the effects of plant diversity on ecosystem functioning has involved synthetically assembled communities, in which the experimental design determines species composition. By contrast, the composition of naturally assembled communities is determined by environmental filters, species recruitment and dispersal, and other assembly processes. Consequently, natural communities and ecosystems can differ from synthetic systems in their reaction to changes in diversity. Removal experiments, in which the diversity of naturally assembled communities is manipulated by removing various components, complement synthetic-assemblage experiments in exploring the relationship between diversity and ecosystem functioning. Results of recent removal experiments suggest that they are more useful for understanding the ecosystem effects of local, nonrandom extinctions, changes in the natural abundance of species, and complex interspecific interactions. This makes removal experiments a promising avenue for progress in ecological theory and an important source of information for those involved in making land-use and conservation decisions.},

abstract = {The Cape Floristic Region ('fynbos biome') has very high levels of plant species diversity and endemism. Much of this diversity is concentrated in a relatively small number of clades centered in the region (Cape clades), and these form a vegetation called 'fynbos'. The general explanation for the origin of this diversity is that much of it evolved in the Pliocene and Late Miocene in response to progressive aridification. We present a phylogenetic analysis of an almost complete species sample of the largest clade of Restionaceae, the third largest Cape clade. This indicates that the radiation of the Restionaceae started between 20 and 42 Myr ago, and since then there were no, or at most gradual, changes in the speciation rate in this clade. For seven other clades, the estimated starting dates for their radiation ranges from 7 to 20 Myr ago. Combining the radiation patterns for these clades shows that ca. 15{\%} of the modern species evolved during the Pleistocene, and almost 40{\%} since the beginning of the Pliocene. We suggest that these clades might have radiated in response to the fynbos vegetation increasing its extent in the Cape as a result of climatic change.},

abstract = {We developed interpolated climate surfaces for global land areas (excluding Antarctica) at a spatial resolution of 30 arc s (often referred to as 1-km spatial resolution). The climate elements considered were monthly precipitation and mean, minimum, and maximum temperature. Input data were gathered from a variety of sources and, where possible, were restricted to records from the 1950-2000 period. We used the thin-plate smoothing spline algorithm implemented in the ANUSPLIN package for interpolation, using latitude, longitude, and elevation as independent variables. We quantified uncertainty arising from the input data and the interpolation by mapping weather station density, elevation bias in the weather stations, and elevation variation within grid cells and through data partitioning and cross validation. Elevation bias tended to be negative (stations lower than expected) at high latitudes but positive in the tropics. Uncertainty is highest in mountainous and in poorly sampled areas. Data partitioning showed high uncertainty of the surfaces on isolated islands, e.g. in the Pacific. Aggregating the elevation and climate data to 10 arc min resolution showed an enormous variation within grid cells, illustrating the value of high-resolution surfaces. A comparison with an existing data set at 10 arc min resolution showed overall agreement, but with significant variation in some regions. A comparison with two high-resolution data sets for the United States also identified areas with large local differences, particularly in mountainous areas. Compared to previous global climatologies, ours has the following advantages: the data are at a higher spatial resolution (400 times greater or more); more weather station records were used; improved elevation data were used; and more information about spatial patterns of uncertainty in the data is available. Owing to the overall low density of available climate stations, our surfaces do not capture of all variation that may occur at a resolution of 1 km, particularly of precipitation in mountainous areas. In future work, such variation might be captured through knowledge-based methods and inclusion of additional co-variates, particularly layers obtained through remote sensing.

There is also a growing appreciation that polyploidy is more than the sum of the gene duplications it creates, in part because polyploidy duplicates the members of entire regulatory networks. Thus, it may be important to distinguish paralogs that are produced by individual gene duplications from the homoeologous sequences produced by (allo)polyploidy. This is not a simple task, for several reasons, including the chromosomally cryptic nature of many duplications and the variable rates of gene evolution.

We thus recommend assessing the influence of inorganic carbon and temperature on natural aquatic communities of variable density in addition to studying detached leaves in the scenarios of rising CO2 and temperature. Moreover, a growing number of researchers are interested in tolerance of terrestrial plants during flooding as torrential rains sometimes result in overland floods that inundate terrestrial plants. We propose to undertake studies to elucidate the importance of leaf acclimation of terrestrial plants to facilitate gas exchange and light utilization under water as these acclimations influence underwater photosynthesis as well as internal aeration of plant tissues during submergence.},

abstract = {Natural selection commonly drives the origin of species, as Darwin initially claimed. Mechanisms of speciation by selection fall into two broad categories: ecological and mutation-order. Under ecological speciation, divergence is driven by divergent natural selection between environments, whereas under mutation-order speciation, divergence occurs when different mutations arise and are fixed in separate populations adapting to similar selection pressures. Tests of parallel evolution of reproductive isolation, trait-based assortative mating, and reproductive isolation by active selection have demonstrated that ecological speciation is a common means by which new species arise. Evidence for mutation-order speciation by natural selection is more limited and has been best documented by instances of reproductive isolation resulting from intragenomic conflict. However, we still have not identified all aspects of selection, and identifying the underlying genes for reproductive isolation remains challenging.},

Phylogenetic analyses were conducted in Photinia sensu lato and several related genera based on two chloroplast DNA regions and nrITS sequences, separately and in combination, and nine non-molecular characters were plotted onto a phylogeny based on the combined molecular data. All phylogenetic trees produced indicated that Stranvaesia should be merged into Photinia, while Pourthiaea and Aronia should be delimited as two separate genera. Ph. davidsoniae and Ph. nussia form a separate clade in our consensus trees and Ph. davidsoniae is speculated to have originated from hybridization between Photinia and some other genus of Pyrinae characterized by spines on the stem, but the specific hybrid origin cannot be inferred in detail due to lack of samples included in our data. The relationships among two taxa of Photinia from Mexico and Central America and species distributed in eastern Asia are also discussed. Ph. microcarpa subsp. hintonii var. hintonii is sister to species in eastern Asia is supported, but with weak support, while the position of a second taxon from Mexico, whose identity is uncertain, is unresolved, indicating the need for further taxonomic and biogeographic studies of these species.

abstract = {This study investigates patterns of genetic connectivity among 11 co-distributed tropical rainforest tree species from the genus Elaeocarpus across a biogeographic barrier, the Black Mountain Corridor (BMC) in the Australian Wet Tropics (AWT). We analysed a combination of allelic and flanking region sequence data from microsatellite markers, and evaluated the relative influence of environmental preferences and functional traits on genetic diversity and gene flow. The results indicate that only in three species geographic structuring of haplotype distribution reflects a north vs. south of the BMC pattern. Environmental factors linked with altitude were recognized as affecting genetic trends, but the selective processes operating on upland species appear to be associated with competitiveness and regeneration opportunities on poor soil types rather than climate variables alone. In contrast to previous observations within southeastern Australian rainforests, genetic differentiation in the AWT appears to be associated with small-fruited rather than large-fruited species, highlighting how external factors can influence the dispersal dimension. Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of considering functional and environmental factors when attempting generalizations on landscape-level patterns of genetic variation. Understanding how plant functional groups respond to environmental and climatic heterogeneity can help us predict responses to future change.},

Dominant taxa in white-sand forests were phylogenetically clustered, consistent with environmental filtering of conserved traits. Phylobetadiversity measures found significant phylogenetic clustering between terra firme communities separated by geographic distances of {\textless} 200-300 km, consistent within recent local speciation at the watershed scale in the Miocene-aged clay-soil forests near the foothills of the Andes. Although both distance and habitat type yielded statistically significant effects on both species and phylogenetic turnover, the patterns we observed were more consistent with an effect of habitat specialization than dispersal limitation.

abstract = {Forest responses to climate change will depend on demographic impacts in the context of competition. Current models used to predict species responses, termed climate envelope models (CEMs), are controversial, because (i) calibration and prediction are based on correlations in space (CIS) between species abundance and climate, rather than responses to climate change over time (COT), and (ii) they omit competition. To determine the relative importance of COT, CIS, and competition for light, we applied a longitudinal analysis of 27 000 individual trees over 6-18 years subjected to experimental and natural variation in risk factors. Sensitivities and climate and resource tracking identify which species are vulnerable to these risk factors and in what ways. Results show that responses to COT differ from those predicted based on CIS. The most important impact is the effect of spring temperature on fecundity, rather than any input variable on growth or survival. Of secondary importance is growing season moisture. Species in the genera Pinus, Ulmus, Magnolia, and Fagus are particularly vulnerable to climate variation. However, the effect of competition on growth and mortality risk exceeds the effects of climate variation in space or time for most species. Because sensitivities to COT and competition are larger than CIS, current models miss the most important effects. By directly comparing sensitivity to climate in time and space, together with competition, the approach identifies which species are sensitive to climate change and why, including the heretofore overlooked impact on fecundity.},

The Paulo C{\'{e}}sar Vinha State Park (PCVSP), in Setiba, Guarapari Municipality (ES), is the best studied of all restinga conservation units in the state of Esp{\'{i}}rito Santo. But there is still much to be learned concerning the flora of some of the plant communities found here. From 1997 to 2000, plants were collected on random walks through approximately four hectares of forest that covers the outer beach ridges of the PCVSP. A total of 172 species were surveyed, belonging to 54 families. The most species-rich families are Myrtaceae (25 spp.), Bromeliaceae (14), Orchidaceae (13), Sapotaceae (10), Lauraceae (7), and Rubiaceae (7). The most common geographic distribution pattern, based on the literature, was that of Atlantic coast species, followed by widespread species, species found on both the Atlantic coast and in central Brazil, disjunct species and those endemic to Esp{\'{i}}rito Santo. Floristic similarity with other coastal areas is directly related to the distance between these areas. The presence of endemic and threatened species in the neighborhood of the Park reinforces the need for effective conservation of this area and provides the incentive to create other conservation units in the restingas of Esp{\'{i}}rito Santo State.},

Phylogenetic analyses of these families are presented based on rbcL and trnL-F plastid DNA sequences. Likelihood ratio tests revealed rate heterogeneity in both phylogenetic trees and they were therefore made ultrametric using non-parametric rate smoothing and penalized likelihood. Divergence times were then estimated using fossil calibration points. The historical biogeography of these families that are species rich in different biomes is discussed and compared with other published reconstructions. Rhamnaceae and most lineages within Annonaceae are too young to have had their distribution patterns influenced by break-up of previously connected Gondwanan landmasses. Contrasts in the degree of geographical structure between these two families may be explained by differences in age and dispersal capability. In both groups, long-distance dispersal appears to have played a more significant role in establishing modern patterns than had previously been assumed. Both families also contain examples of recent diversification of species-rich lineages. An understanding of the processes responsible for shaping the distribution patterns of these families has contributed to our understanding of the historical assembly of the biomes that they occupy.},

abstract = {Many recent studies have evaluated how global changes will affect biodiversity, and have mainly focused on how to develop conservation strategies to avoN1, or at least minimize, extinctions due to shifts in suitable habitats for the species. However, these complex potential responses might be in part structured in phylogeny, because of the macroecological traits underlying them. In this comment, we review recent analytical developments in phylogenetic comparative methods that can be used to understand patterns of trait changes under environmental change. We focus on a partial regression approach that allows for partitioning the variance of traits into a fraction attributed to a pure ecological component, a fraction attributed to phylogenetically structured environmental variation (niche conservatism) and a fraction that may be attributed to phylogenetic effects only. We then develop a novel interpretation for linking these components for multiple traits with potential responses of species to global environmental change (i.e. adaptation, range shifts or extinctions). We hope that this interpretation will stimulate further research linking evolutionary components of multiple traits with broad-scale environmental changes},

abstract = {Ecologists are increasingly adopting an evolutionary perspective, and in recent years, the idea that closely related species are ecologically similar has become widespread. In this regard, phylogenetic signal must be distinguished from phylogenetic niche conservatism. Phylogenetic niche conservatism results when closely related species are more ecologically similar that would be expected based on their phylogenetic relationships; its occurrence suggests that some process is constraining divergence among closely related species. In contrast, phylogenetic signal refers to the situation in which ecological similarity between species is related to phylogenetic relatedness; this is the expected outcome of Brownian motion divergence and thus is necessary, but not sufficient, evidence for the existence of phylogenetic niche conservatism. Although many workers consider phylogenetic niche conservatism to be common, a review of case studies indicates that ecological and phylogenetic similarities often are not related. Consequently, ecologists should not assume that phylogenetic niche conservatism exists, but rather should empirically examine the extent to which it occurs.},

abstract = {Circaea (Onagraceae) consists of eight species and six subspecies distributed in Eurasia and North America. The sister group of Circaea was recently shown to be Fuchsia, which comprises 107 species primarily distributed in montane Central and South America, including four species occurring in the South Pacific islands. Three plastid markers (petB-petD, rpl16, and trnL-F) and nrITS sequences from 13 of the 14 taxa of Circaea were sequenced and used to reconstruct the phylogenetic and biogeographic history of the genus. Parsimony and Bayesian analyses support that (1) Circaea is monophyletic; (2) the bilocular group is a weakly supported clade nested within the unilocular grade; (3) neither the C. alpina complex nor the C. canadensis complex is monophyletic; and (4) the western North American C. alpina subsp. pacifica diverged first in the genus. Divergence time estimates based on the Bayesian "relaxed" clock methods suggest that the earliest Circaea divergence occurred minimally at 16.17 mya (95{\%} HPD: 7.69-24.53 mya). Biogeographic analyses using divergence-vicariance analysis (DIVA) and a likelihood method support the New World origin of Circaea. Three independent dispersal events between Eurasia and North America via the Bering land bridge were inferred within Circaea. Higher taxon diversity of Circaea in eastern Asia was probably caused by geologic and ecological changes during the late Tertiary in the Northern Hemisphere. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Before that time, systematics was not at the forefront of the biological sciences, and few scientists considered phylogenetic relationships when investigating evolutionary questions. By contrast, systematic biology is now one of the most vigorous disciplines in biology, and the use of phylogenies not only is requisite in macroevolutionary studies but also has been applied to a wide range of topics and fields that no one could possibly have envisioned 30 years ago. My message is simple: phylogenies are fundamental to comparative biology, but they are not the be-all and end-all. Phylogenies are powerful tools for understanding the past, but like any tool, they have their limitations. In addition, phylogenies are much more informative about pattern than they are about process. The best way to fully understand the past-both pattern and process-is to integrate phylogenies with other types of historical data as well as with direct studies of evolutionary process.},

abstract = {1. Once neglected, the role of facilitative interactions in plant communities has received consider-able attention in the last two decades, and is now widely recognized. It is timely to consider the progress made by research in this field. 2. We review the development of plant facilitation research, focusing on the history of the field, the relationship between plant–plant interactions and environmental severity gradients, and attempts to integrate facilitation into mainstream ecological theory. We then consider future directions for facilitation research. 3. With respect to our fundamental understanding of plant facilitation, clarification of the relationship between interactions and environmental gradients is central for further progress, and necessitates the design and implementation of experiments that move beyond the clear limitations of previous studies. 4. There is substantial scope for exploring indirect facilitative effects in plant communities, including their impacts on diversity and evolution, and future studies should connect the degree of non-transitivity in plant competitive networks to community diversity and facilitative promotion of species coexistence, and explore how the role of indirect facilitation varies with environmental severity. 5. Certain ecological modelling approaches (e.g. individual-based modelling), although thus far largely neglected, provide highly useful tools for exploring these fundamental processes. 6. Evolutionary responses might result from facilitative interactions, and consideration of facilitation might lead to re-assessment of the evolution of plant growth forms. 7. Improved understanding of facilitation processes has direct relevance for the development of tools for ecosystem restoration, and for improving our understanding of the response of plant species and communities to environmental change drivers. 8. Attempts to apply our developing ecological knowledge would benefit from explicit recognition of the potential role of facilitative plant–plant interactions in the design and interpretation of studies from the fields of restoration and global change ecology. 9. Synthesis: Plant facilitation research provides new insights into classic ecological theory and pressing environmental issues. Awareness and understanding of facilitation should be part of the basic ecological knowledge of all plant ecologists.},

The broad congruence of these variations with climatic and environmental conditions on local, regional, and global scales has fostered the concept that plant ecophysiological characteristics are well adapted to their local circumstances. For example, the repeated occurrence of plants with CAM (Crassulacean Acid Metabolism) photosynthesis and succulent leaves or stems in severely water-limited environments, and the independent evolution of these traits in numerous plant lineages, provides compelling evidence of the physiological evolution of these water-conserving traits under the influence of natural selection (Ehleringer and Monson 1993). Similarly, studies of the evolution of heavy metal tolerance confirm that natural selection may cause rapid ecophysiological evolution in just a few generations, leading to local adaptation in populations just a few meters apart (Antonovics et al. 1971).},

abstract = {—In this paper, we present a new way to describe the timing of branching events in phylogenetic trees. Our description is in terms of the relative timing of diversification events between sister clades; as such it is complementary to existing methods using lineages-through-time plots which consider diversification in aggregate. The method can be applied to look for evidence of diversification happening in lineage-specific " bursts " , or the opposite, where diversification between 2 clades happens in an unusually regular fashion. In order to be able to distinguish interesting events from stochasticity, we discuss 2 classes of neutral models on trees with rela-tive timing information and develop a statistical framework for testing these models. These model classes in-clude both the coalescent with ancestral population size variation and global rate speciation–extinction models. We end the paper with 2 example applications: first, we show that the evolution of the hepatitis C virus deviates from the coalescent with arbitrary population size. Second, we analyze a large tree of ants, demonstrating that a period of elevated diversification rates does not appear to have occurred in a bursting manner. [Branch length; key in-novation; neutral models; phylogenetics.] Understanding the tempo and mode of diversifica-tion is one of the major challenges of evolutionary bi-ology. Phylogenetic trees with timing information are powerful tools for answering questions about tempo and mode. Such trees were once available only in sit-uations with a rich fossil record, where the timing in-formation might have come from radiocarbon dating or stratigraphic information. However, modern techniques of phylogenetic analysis not only are capable of recon-structing the topology of phylogenetic trees, but also can reconstruct information about the timing of diversifica-tion events even when limited or no fossil evidence is available. This can be done in one of a number of ways. One can first test if a molecular clock is appropriate (see Felsenstein 1981, 1988) and then reconstruct under the assumption of a molecular clock. Or one can recon-struct a tree with branch lengths using any method and then apply rate smoothing (Sanderson 2003). One may also choose from the variety of " relaxed clock " meth-ods that allow the rate of substitution to vary within the tree (Gillespie 1984; Huelsenbeck et al. 2000; Drum-mond et al. 2006). Of course, the accuracy of any of these techniques depends on a correct choice of model and a strong phylogenetic signal, along with perhaps some fossil calibration points. Phylogenetic trees with timing information can then be used to make inferences about the forces guiding the evolution of the taxa. For example, the paper by Moreau et al. (2006) observes that there was a period of high diversification rate in ant lineages during the rise of angiosperms. Another paper by Harmon et al. (2003) uses the deviation of 4 groups of lizards from the pure-birth (i.e., constant rate of speciation across lineages; no extinction) model of diversification to make inferences about their evolutionary radiations.},

We have developed a reliable and efficient method for isolating genomic DNA free from polysaccharide, polyphenols and protein contaminants from tropical tuber crops (Elephant foot yam, Cassava, Sweet potato Taro and Tannia). The method involves inactivation of contaminant proteins by using CTAB/Proteinase K and precipitation of polysaccharides in the presence of high concentration of salt. The purity of genomic DNA was confirmed by A260/280 and A260/230 ratios calculated from the spectrophotometric readings and further by restriction analysis of the isolated DNA using restriction enzymes EcoRI and Hind III. The described protocol also resulted in the isolation of sufficiently higher yield of DNA from leaf sample of tropical tuber crops. The new protocol can be successfully used for both small and large scale preparation of genomic DNA from leaf tissues of tuber crops which is highly suitable for further down stream processes like PCR amplification and restriction digestion analysis.},

abstract = {Evolution and ecological diversification in a heterogeneous environment is driven by an often complex interplay between local adaptation and dispersal between different habitat types. Heterogeneous environments also easily generate source-sink dynamics of populations coupled by dispersal. It follows that local adaptation and possible adaptive radiation almost by necessity involves adaptation to a (pseudo-)sink habitat, which is considered unlikely. We here study a model of ‘parapatric branching' with this special focus on the spatial ecology of the process. We find that evolutionary branching can display a sequence of alternating adaptations to the source or the sink. In some circumstances a true sink can become a pseudo-sink through adaptation to the corresponding source habitat.

abstract = {The problem of scale dependency is widespread in investigations of ecological communities. Null model investigations of community assembly exemplify the challenges involved because they typically include subjectively defined "regional species pools." The burgeoning field of community phylogenetics appears poised to face similar challenges. Our objective is to quantify the scope of the problem of scale dependency by comparing the phylogenetic structure of assemblages across contrasting geographic and taxonomic scales. We conduct phylogenetic analyses on communities within three tropical forests, and perform a sensitivity analysis with respect to two scaleable inputs: taxonomy and species pool size. We show that (1) estimates of phylogenetic overdispersion within local assemblages depend strongly on the taxonomic makeup of the local assemblage and (2) comparing the phylogenetic structure of a local assemblage to a species pool drawn from increasingly larger geographic scales results in an increased signal of phylogenetic clustering. We argue that, rather than posing a problem, "scale sensitivities" are likely to reveal general patterns of diversity that could help identify critical scales at which local or regional influences gain primacy for the structuring of communities. In this way, community phylogenetics promises to fill an important gap in community ecology and biogeography research.},

abstract = {Susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) is a newly developed magnetic resonance (MR) protocol. Recent studies have found that SWI may be useful in the field of cerebrovascular diseases, especially for detecting the presence of prominent veins, microbleeds and the susceptibility vessel sign (SVS). Some authors have even suggested that SWI can be used to predict outcome. We conducted a prospective study of patients hospitalized with middle cerebral artery territory infarction receiving MRI within 2 days of stroke onset. The presence of prominent veins, microbleeds and SVS in SWI was analyzed along with hospital characteristics of the patients. A total of 44 patients were enrolled. Among the 44 patients, 15 (34.1{\%}) patients showed prominent veins, 19 (43.2{\%}) showed SVS, and 14 (31.8{\%}) showed microbleeds. The presence of SVS and prominent veins was not associated with prognosis. Though not statistically significant (p = 0.06), patients with SVS were more likely to develop later brain edema. SVS was significantly associated with arterial occlusion (p = 0.008) based on the MR angiogram, and microbleeds were significantly associated with later hemorrhagic transformation (p = 0.018). In our study, SWI could not be used to predict outcome as previously suggested. However, the presence of microbleeds may predict further hemorrhagic transformation, and the presence of SVS could be used to detect intra-arterial thrombus. Patients with SVS were also more likely to develop later brain edema. Including SWI in routine MR protocols for major acute ischemic stroke would be worthwhile.},

Temperate diffuse-porous trees were at the opposite extreme, and conifers and tropical diffuse-porous species were intermediate. Scaling of Kh was influenced by differences in the allometry of conduit diameter (taper) and packing (number per wood area) with stem size. * •The Kh trends were mirrored by the modeled stem-network conductances. Ring-porous species had the greatest network conductance and this value increased isometrically with trunk basal area, indicating that conductance per unit sapwood was independent of tree size. Conductances were lowest and most size-dependent in conifers. The results indicate that differences in conduit taper and packing between functional types propagate to the network level and have an important influence on metabolic scaling concepts.},

The neutral theory, which assumes that individuals are demographically identical regardless of species, seeks to explain ubiquitous features of community structure and biodiversity patterns. Here we present a test of neutral-theory predictions with the use of an extensive species-level data set of Indo-Pacific coral communities. We show that coral assemblages differ markedly from neutral-model predictions for patterns of community similarity and the relative abundance of species. Within local communities, neutral models do not fit relative abundance distributions as well as the classical log-normal distribution. Relative abundances of species across local communities also differ markedly from neutral-theory predictions: coral communities exhibit community similarity values that are far more variable, and lower on average, than the neutral theory can produce. Empirical community similarities deviate from the neutral model in a direction opposite to that predicted in previous critiques of the neutral theory. Instead, our results support spatio-temporal environmental stochasticity as a major driver of diversity patterns on coral reefs.},

In a replicated chronosequence of 30 sites in northeastern Costa Rica, I found strong phylogenetic overdispersion at multiple scales: species present at local sites were a non-random assemblage, more distantly related than chance would predict. Phylogenetic overdispersion was evident when comparing the species present at each site with the regional species pool, the species pool found in each age category to the regional pool or the species present at each site to the pool of species found in sites of that age category. Comparing stem size classes within each age category, I found that during early succession, phylogenetic overdispersion is strongest in small stems. Overdispersion strengthens and spreads into larger size classes as succession proceeds, corroborating an existing model of forest succession. This study is the first evidence that succession leaves a distinct signature in the phylogenetic structure of communities.},

To achieve this we first implemented a rich family of microsatellite mutation models and related components in the software package BEAST. BEAST is a powerful tool that performs Bayesian MCMC analysis on molecular data to make coalescent and evolutionary inferences. Our implementation permits the application of existing nonparametric methods to microsatellite data. The implemented microsatellite models are based on the replication slippage mechanism and focus on three properties of microsatellite mutation: length dependency of mutation rate, mutational bias toward expansion or contraction, and number of repeat units changed in a single mutation event. We develop a new model that facilitates microsatellite model averaging and Bayesian model selection by transdimensional MCMC. With Bayesian model averaging, the posterior distributions of population history parameters are integrated across a set of microsatellite models and thus account for model uncertainty. Simulated data are used to evaluate our method in terms of accuracy and precision of estimation and also identification of the true mutation model. Finally we apply our method to a red colobus monkey data set as an example.},

abstract = {Explaining the ecological causes of evolutionary diversification is a major focus of biology, but surprisingly little has been said about the effects of evolutionary diversification on ecosystems. The number of species in an ecosystem and their traits are key predictors of many ecosystem-level processes, such as rates of productivity, biomass sequestration and decomposition. Here we demonstrate short-term ecosystem-level effects of adaptive radiation in the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) over the past 10,000 years. These fish have undergone recent parallel diversification in several lakes in coastal British Columbia, resulting in the formation of two specialized species (benthic and limnetic) from a generalist ancestor. Using a mesocosm experiment, we demonstrate that this diversification has strong effects on ecosystems, affecting prey community structure, total primary production, and the nature of dissolved organic materials that regulate the spectral properties of light transmission in the system. However, these ecosystem effects do not simply increase in their relative strength with increasing specialization and species richness; instead, they reflect the complex and indirect consequences of ecosystem engineering by sticklebacks. It is well known that ecological factors influence adaptive radiation. We demonstrate that adaptive radiation, even over short timescales, can have profound effects on ecosystems.},

However, a positive (or negative) association between two species does not necessarily signify a direct or indirect interaction, as it can result simply from the species having similar (or dissimilar) habitat requirements. We show how these two factors can be separated by multivariate logistic regression, with the regression part accounting for species-specific habitat requirements, and a correlation matrix for the positive or negative residual associations. We parameterize the model using Bayesian inference with data on 22 species of wood-decaying fungi acquired in 14 dissimilar forest sites. Our analyses reveal that some of the species commonly found to occur together in the same logs are likely to do so merely by similar habitat requirements, whereas other species combinations are systematically either over- or underrepresented also or only after accounting for the habitat requirements. We use our results to derive hypotheses on species interactions that can be tested in future experimental work.},

abstract = {— The phylogeny of the thrushes (Aves: Turdus) has been difficult to reconstruct due to short internal branches and lack of node support for certain parts of the tree. Reconstructing the biogeographic history of this group is further complicated by the fact that current implementations of biogeographic methods, such as dispersal-vicariance analysis (DIVA; Ronquist, 1997), require a fully resolved tree. Here, we apply a Bayesian approach to dispersal-vicariance analysis that accounts for phylogenetic uncertainty and allows a more accurate analysis of the biogeographic history of lineages. Specifically, ancestral area reconstructions can be presented as marginal distributions, thus displaying the underlying topological uncertainty. Moreover, if there are multiple optimal solutions for a single node on a certain tree, integrating over the posterior distribution of trees often reveals a preference for a narrower set of solutions. We find that despite the uncertainty in tree topology, ancestral area reconstructions indicate that the Turdus clade originated in the eastern Palearctic during the Late Miocene. This was followed by an early dispersal to Africa from where a worldwide radiation took place. The uncertainty in tree topology and short branch lengths seems to indicate that this radiation took place within a limited time span during the Late Pliocene. The results support the role of Africa as a probable source area for intercontinental dispersals as suggested for other passerine groups, including basal diversification within the songbird tree.

abstract = {Question: Is the pattern of phenotypic divergence among populations influenced by constraint in the form of the genetic covariances among characters? Background: Quantitative genetic theory predicts that when evolutionary lineages diverge simultaneously by genetic drift, the pattern of among-population divergence will parallel the pattern of within-population genetic variation and covariation. Among-population divergence is measured by the variance–covariance matrix of population means (the D matrix), or by the variance–covariance matrix of independent contrasts (DIC ). The latter avoids the assumption of simultaneous divergence by incorporating phylogenetic non-independence among lineages and was developed expressly for this study. Within-population genetic variation and covariation are measured by the additive genetic variance–covariance matrix (the G matrix). Organism: The Puerto Rican crested anole (Anolis cristatellus). Methods: We sampled A. cristatellus from seven divergent populations widely dispersed across the species' range. These populations are sufficiently highly diverged to be considered evolutionarily independent lineages. We substituted the phenotypic variance–covariance matrix (P matrix) for G in evolutionary analysis. (Empirical studies have shown that P and G are frequently highly correlated for morphological traits.) In two populations, we estimated phenotypic variance–covariance matrices (P matrices) for 13 skeletal morphological traits, while in the remaining five we estimated mean phenotypes for the same traits. To test the hypothesis of constraint, we first calculated a pooled phenotypic variance–covariance matrix (P ¯¯) from all populations. We compared P ¯¯ to the variance–covariance matrix of population means (D) and of independent contrasts (DIC ). Independent contrasts were calculated using a molecular phylogeny of the included lineages. Results: Comparison of P matrices between populations showed evidence that covariance structure is highly conserved in conspecific populations of A. cristatellus. Comparison of P ¯¯ with D and of P ¯¯ with DIC indicated significant similarity in both cases, suggesting that constraint has influenced phenotypic evolution and thus probably genotypic evolution in this species.},

Recent work suggests that bacterial biodiversity might exhibit patterns similar to those of plants and animals. However, relative to our knowledge about the diversity of macro-organisms, we know little about patterns of relatedness in free-living bacterial communities, and relatively few studies have quantitatively examined community structure in a phylogenetic framework. Here we apply phylogenetic tools to bacterial diversity data to determine whether bacterial communities are phylogenetically structured. We find that bacterial communities tend to contain lower taxonomic diversity and are more likely to be phylogenetically clustered than expected by chance. Such phylogenetic clustering may indicate the importance of habitat filtering (where a group of closely related species shares a trait, or suite of traits, that allow them to persist in a given habitat) in the assembly of bacterial communities. Microbial communities are especially accessible for phylogenetic analysis and thus have the potential to figure prominently in the integration of evolutionary biology and community ecology.},

abstract = {Interactions between natural selection and environmental change are well recognized and sit at the core of ecology and evolutionary biology. Reciprocal interactions between ecology and evolution, eco-evolutionary feedbacks, are less well studied, even though they may be critical for understanding the evolution of biological diversity, the structure of communities and the function of ecosystems. Eco-evolutionary feedbacks require that populations alter their environment (niche construction) and that those changes in the environment feed back to influence the subsequent evolution of the population. There is strong evidence that organisms influence their environment through predation, nutrient excretion and habitat modification, and that populations evolve in response to changes in their environment at time-scales congruent with ecological change (contemporary evolution). Here, we outline how the niche construction and contemporary evolution interact to alter the direction of evolution and the structure and function of communities and ecosystems. We then present five empirical systems that highlight important characteristics of eco-evolutionary feedbacks: rotifer-algae chemostats; alewife-zooplankton interactions in lakes; guppy life-history evolution and nutrient cycling in streams; avian seed predators and plants; and tree leaf chemistry and soil processes. The alewife-zooplankton system provides the most complete evidence for eco-evolutionary feedbacks, but other systems highlight the potential for eco-evolutionary feedbacks in a wide variety of natural systems.},

abstract = {1. The fraction of sampling units in a landscape where a target species is present (occupancy) is an extensively used concept in ecology. Yet in many applications the species will not always be detected in a sampling unit even when present, resulting in biased estimates of occupancy. Given that sampling units are surveyed repeatedly within a relatively short timeframe, a number of similar methods have now been developed to provide unbiased occupancy estimates. However, practical guidance on the efficient design of occupancy studies has been lacking. 2. In this paper we comment on a number of general issues related to designing occupancy studies, including the need for clear objectives that are explicitly linked to science or management, selection of sampling units, timing of repeat surveys and allocation of survey effort. Advice on the number of repeat surveys per sampling unit is considered in terms of the variance of the occupancy estimator, for three possible study designs. 3. We recommend that sampling units should be surveyed a minimum of three times when detection probability is high ({\textgreater} 0{\textperiodcentered}5 survey-1), unless a removal design is used. 4. We found that an optimal removal design will generally be the most efficient, but we suggest it may be less robust to assumption violations than a standard design. 5. Our results suggest that for a rare species it is more efficient to survey more sampling units less intensively, while for a common species fewer sampling units should be surveyed more intensively. 6. Synthesis and applications. Reliable inferences can only result from quality data. To make the best use of logistical resources, study objectives must be clearly defined; sampling units must be selected, and repeated surveys timed appropriately; and a sufficient number of repeated surveys must be conducted. Failure to do so may compromise the integrity of the study. The guidance given here on study design issues is particularly applicable to studies of species occurrence and distribution, habitat selection and modelling, metapopulation studies and monitoring programmes.},

abstract = {Ants are one of the most ecologically and numerically dominant group of terrestrial organisms with most species diversity currently found in tropical climates. Several explanations for the disparity of biological diversity in the tropics compared to temperate regions have been proposed including that the tropics may act as a "museum" where older lineages persist through evolutionary time or as a "cradle" where new species continue to be generated. We infer the molecular phylogenetic relationships of 295 ant specimens including members of all 21 extant subfamilies to explore the evolutionary diversification and biogeography of the ants. By constraining the topology and age of the root node while using 45 fossils as minimum constraints, we converge on an age of 139-158 Mya for the modern ants. Further diversification analyses identified 10 periods with a significant change in the tempo of diversification of the ants, although these shifts did not appear to correspond to ancestral biogeographic range shifts. Likelihood-based historical biogeographic reconstructions suggest that the Neotropics were important in early ant diversification (e.g., Cretaceous). This finding coupled with the extremely high-current species diversity suggests that the Neotropics have acted as both a museum and cradle for ant diversity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Flooding causes substantial stress for terrestrial plants, particularly if the floodwater completely submerges the shoot. The main problems during submergence are shortage of oxygen due to the slow diffusion rates of gases in water, and depletion of carbohydrates, which is the substrate for respiration. These two factors together lead to loss of biomass and eventually death of the submerged plants. Although conditions under water are unfavourable with respect to light and carbon dioxide supply, photosynthesis may provide both oxygen and carbohydrates, resulting in continuation of aerobic respiration. SCOPE: This review focuses on evidence in the literature that photosynthesis contributes to survival of terrestrial plants during complete submergence. Furthermore, we discuss relevant morphological and physiological responses of the shoot of terrestrial plant species that enable the positive effects of light on underwater plant performance. CONCLUSIONS: Light increases the survival of terrestrial plants under water, indicating that photosynthesis commonly occurs under these submerged conditions. Such underwater photosynthesis increases both internal oxygen concentrations and carbohydrate contents, compared with plants submerged in the dark, and thereby alleviates the adverse effects of flooding. Additionally, several terrestrial species show high plasticity with respect to their leaf development. In a number of species, leaf morphology changes in response to submergence, probably to facilitate underwater gas exchange. Such increased gas exchange may result in higher assimilation rates, and lower carbon dioxide compensation points under water, which is particularly important at the low carbon dioxide concentrations observed in the field. As a result of higher internal carbon dioxide concentrations in submergence-acclimated plants, underwater photorespiration rates are expected to be lower than in non-acclimated plants. Furthermore, the regulatory mechanisms that induce the switch from terrestrial to submergence-acclimated leaves may be controlled by the same pathways as described for heterophyllous aquatic plants.},

abstract = {Stochastic niche theory resolves many of the differences between neutral theory and classical tradeoff-based niche theories of resource competition and community structure. In stochastic niche theory, invading species become established only if propagules can survive stochastic mortality while growing to maturity on the resources left unconsumed by established species. The theory makes three predictions about community structure. First, stochastic niche assembly creates communities in which species dominate approximately equally wide "slices" of the habitat's spatial heterogeneity. These niche widths generate realistic distributions of species relative abundances for which, contrary to neutral theory but consistent with numerous observations, there are strong correlations among species traits, species abundances, and environmental conditions. Second, slight decreases in resource levels are predicted to cause large decreases in the probability that a propagule would survive to be an adult. These decreases cause local diversity to be limited by the inhibitory effects of resource use by established species on the establishment (recruitment) of potential invaders. If resource pulses or disturbance allowed invaders to overcome this recruitment limitation, many more species could indefinitely coexist. Third, the low invasibility of high diversity communities is predicted to result not from diversity per se, but from the uniformly low levels of resources that occur in high-diversity communities created by stochastic competitive assembly. This prediction provides a potential solution to the invasion paradox, which is the tendency for highly diverse regions to be more heavily invaded.},

abstract = {Chloroplast microsatellites (cpSSRs) provide a powerful tool to study the genetic variation and evolution of plants. We have investigated the usefulness of 39 primer pairs tagging cpSSR loci on a set of eight different genera of Leguminosae (Papilionoideae subfamily) and five species belonging to the genus Phaseolus. Thirty-six 'universal' primer pairs were retrieved from the literature, one was re-designed and a further two were designed de novo. The cpSSR loci analysed were highly polymorphic across the individuals examined. Twenty-seven primer pairs were polymorphic in the overall sample, 18 within Phaseolus, and 16 in both P. vulgaris and P. coccineus. Analysis of the plastome sequences of four Leguminosae species (obtained from GenBank) showed that in the loci targeted by universal primer pairs: (i) the originally tagged cpSSRs can be lost; (ii) other cpSSRs can be present; and (iii) polymorphism arises not only from differences in the numbers of cpSSR repeats, but often from other insertion/deletion events. Multilocus linkage disequilibrium analysis suggests that homoplasy is not a major problem in our dataset, and principal component analysis indicates intelligible relationships among the species considered. Our study demonstrates that this set of chloroplast markers provides a useful tool to study the diversity and the evolution of several legumes, and particularly P. vulgaris and P. coccineus.},

abstract = {A species-addition experiment showed that prairie grasslands have a structured, nonneutral assembly process in which resident species inhibit, via resource consumption, the establishment and growth of species with similar resource use patterns and in which the success of invaders decreases as diversity increases. In our experiment, species in each of four functional guilds were introduced, as seed, into 147 prairie-grassland plots that previously had been established and maintained to have different compositions and diversities. Established species most strongly inhibited introduced species from their own functional guild. Introduced species attained lower abundances when functionally similar species were abundant and when established species left lower levels of resources unconsumed, which occurred at higher [corrected] species richness. Residents of the C4 grass functional guild, the dominant guild in nearby native grasslands, reduced the major limiting resource, soil nitrate, to the lowest levels in midsummer and exhibited the greatest inhibitory effect on introduced species. This simple mechanism of greater competitive inhibition of invaders that are similar to established abundant species could, in theory, explain many of the patterns observed in plant communities.},

Several recent studies have tried to use the distribution of estimates of Fst from individual genetic loci to detect the effects of natural selection. However, the promise of this approach has yet to be fully realized owing to the pervasive dogma that this distribution is highly dependent on demographic history. Here, I review recent theoretical results that indicate that the distribution of estimates of Fst is generally expected to be robust to the vagaries of demographic history. I suggest that analyses based on it provide a useful first step for identifying candidate genes that might be under selection, and explore the ways in which this information can be used in ecological and evolutionary studies. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Maximum likelihood is a potentially powerful approach for investigating the tempo of diversification using molecular phylogenetic data. Likelihood methods distinguish between rate-constant and rate-variable models of di-versification by fitting birth-death models to phylogenetic data. Because model selection in this context is a test of the null hypothesis that diversification rates have been constant over time, strategies for selecting best-fit models must minimize Type I error rates while retaining power to detect rate variation when it is present. Here I examine model selection, parameter estimation, and power to reject the null hypothesis using likelihood models based on the birth-death process. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) has often been used to select among diversification models; however, I find that selecting models based on the lowest AIC score leads to a dramatic inflation of the Type I error rate. When appropriately corrected to reduce Type I error rates, the birth-death likelihood approach performs as well or better than the widely used gamma statistic, at least when diversification rates have shifted abruptly over time. Analyses of datasets simulated under a range of rate-variable diversification scenarios indicate that the birth-death likelihood method has much greater power to detect variation in diversification rates when extinction is present. Furthermore, this method appears to be the only approach available that can distinguish between a temporal increase in diversification rates and a rate-constant model with nonzero extinction. I illustrate use of the method by analyzing a published phylogeny for Australian agamid lizards. There is great interest in understanding variation in spe-ciation and extinction rates both over time (e.g., Hey 1992; Sanderson and Donoghue 1996; Barraclough and Nee 2001; Zink et al. 2004; Ruber and Zardoya 2005) and among lin-eages (e.g., Mooers and Heard 1997; Chan and Moore 2002; Moore et al. 2004; Ree 2005). The proliferation of molecular phylogenetic data has provided researchers in this area with a wealth of material for comparative analyses of diversifi-cation. Many intriguing and unanswered questions in evo-lutionary biology concern temporal variation in diversifica-tion rates. For example, how have climatic shifts influenced the tempo of diversification (Zink and Slowinski 1995; Kad-ereit et al. 2004; Weir and Schluter 2004)? How do diver-sification rates vary over time during major evolutionary ra-diations (Harmon et al. 2003; Kozak et al. 2006)? Is early, rapid diversification a general feature of adaptive radiation (Lovette and Bermingham 1999; Schluter 2000)? To address temporal variation in diversification rates, re-searchers use an increasingly sophisticated statistical toolkit. Typically, branch lengths in a reconstructed phylogeny are used to estimate the timing of speciation events, and observed waiting times between successive speciation events are com-pared to the expected distribution under a stochastic branch-ing process where rates have been constant over time (Wol-lenberg et al. 1996). The most widely used null model for diversification rate analyses is the birth-death model (Kendall 1948), where clades grow under constant per-lineage speci-ation and extinction rates. Both parametric and nonparametric statistics have been developed to test the distribution of in-ternal nodes in a molecular phylogeny for departures from the pure-birth process, a special case of the birth-death pro-cess where all lineages have a common per-lineage extinction rate ␮ ϭ 0 (Zink and Slowinski 1995; Paradis 1998b; Pybus and Harvey 2000). Although methods based on the pure-birth process can infer temporal decreases in diversification rates, they are unable to detect temporal increases (Pybus and Harvey 2000; Nee 2001). If the per-lineage extinction rate ␮ is high relative to the speciation rate ␭, we will observe an excess of recently diverged lineages relative to our expectation under the pure-birth model (Fig. 1). This phenomenon, termed the ''pull of the present'' (Nee et al. 1994a), can mislead researchers into concluding that a particular clade has undergone a temporal increase in the net diversification rate (Nee et al. 1994a; Kubo and Iwasa 1995). The distribution of waiting times under the birth-death process is thus contingent on the ratio of extinc-tion and speciation rates. As we typically do not know and cannot reasonably estimate this parameter (Nee et al. 1994a; Paradis 2004), existing methods are limited to testing for temporal declines in diversification rates using the pure-birth null model. Likelihood methods based on the birth-death model are a potentially powerful approach for reconstructing the history of diversification from phylogenetic data. Likelihood is in-creasingly used to reconstruct shifts in diversification rates, either through use of the birth-death model (Barraclough and Vogler 2002; Turgeon et al. 2005) or through a related ap-proach involving survival analysis (Paradis 1997; Emerson et al. 2000; Pitra et al. 2004; Paradis 2005). Rather than explicitly testing a specific null hypothesis of diversification, such as the pure-birth process, likelihood methods do not need to assume a particular parameterization of the birth-death null model. It is thus possible to ask, for example, whether phylogenetic data are more likely to have been gen-erated under a general rate-constant birth-death model (␭ Ͼ 0; ␮ Ն 0), or whether the data are more likely under a model in which rates have varied over time. Use of a general birth-death null model may afford several},

abstract = {The remarkable antiquity, diversity and ecological significance of arthropods have inspired numerous attempts to resolve their deep phylogenetic history, but the results of two decades of intensive molecular phylogenetics have been mixed. The discovery that terrestrial insects (Hexapoda) are more closely related to aquatic Crustacea than to the terrestrial centipedes and millipedes (Myriapoda) was an early, if exceptional, success. More typically, analyses based on limited samples of taxa and genes have generated results that are inconsistent, weakly supported and highly sensitive to analytical conditions. Here we present strongly supported results from likelihood, Bayesian and parsimony analyses of over 41 kilobases of aligned DNA sequence from 62 single-copy nuclear protein-coding genes from 75 arthropod species. These species represent every major arthropod lineage, plus five species of tardigrades and onychophorans as outgroups. Our results strongly support Pancrustacea (Hexapoda plus Crustacea) but also strongly favour the traditional morphology-based Mandibulata (Myriapoda plus Pancrustacea) over the molecule-based Paradoxopoda (Myriapoda plus Chelicerata). In addition to Hexapoda, Pancrustacea includes three major extant lineages of 'crustaceans', each spanning a significant range of morphological disparity. These are Oligostraca (ostracods, mystacocarids, branchiurans and pentastomids), Vericrustacea (malacostracans, thecostracans, copepods and branchiopods) and Xenocarida (cephalocarids and remipedes). Finally, within Pancrustacea we identify Xenocarida as the long-sought sister group to the Hexapoda, a result confirming that 'crustaceans' are not monophyletic. These results provide a statistically well-supported phylogenetic framework for the largest animal phylum and represent a step towards ending the often-heated, century-long debate on arthropod relationships.},

Differences in species compositional turnover among sites ($\beta$ diversity) occurring along gradients are often used to infer variation in the processes structuring communities. Here, we show that sampling alone predicts changes in $\beta$ diversity caused simply by changes in the sizes of species pools. For example, forest inventories sampled along latitudinal and elevational gradients show the well-documented pattern that $\beta$ diversity is higher in the tropics and at low elevations. However, after correcting for variation in pooled species richness ($\gamma$ diversity), these differences in $\beta$ diversity disappear. Therefore, there is no need to invoke differences in the mechanisms of community assembly in temperate versus tropical systems to explain these global-scale patterns of $\beta$ diversity.},

To weigh the risks of AGF against those of maladaptation due to climate change, we need to know the species' extent of local adaptation to climate and other environmental factors, as well as its pattern of gene flow.

abstract = {Approximately 20 years ago, Avise and colleagues proposed the integration of phylogenetics and population genetics for investigating the connection between micro- and macroevolutionary phenomena. The new field was termed phylogeography. Since the naming of the field, the statistical rigor of phylogeography has increased, in large part due to concurrent advances in coalescent theory which enabled model-based parameter estimation and hypothesis testing. The next phase will involve phylogeography increasingly becoming the integrative and comparative multi-taxon endeavor that it was originally conceived to be. This exciting convergence will likely involve combining spatially-explicit multiple taxon coalescent models, genomic studies of natural selection, ecological niche modeling, studies of ecological speciation, community assembly and functional trait evolution. This ambitious synthesis will allow us to determine the causal links between geography, climate change, ecological interactions and the evolution and composition of taxa across whole communities and assemblages. Although such integration presents analytical and computational challenges that will only be intensified by the growth of genomic data in non-model taxa, the rapid development of "likelihood-free" approximate Bayesian methods should permit parameter estimation and hypotheses testing using complex evolutionary demographic models and genomic phylogeographic data. We first review the conceptual beginnings of phylogeography and its accomplishments and then illustrate how it evolved into a statistically rigorous enterprise with the concurrent rise of coalescent theory. Subsequently, we discuss ways in which model-based phylogeography can interface with various subfields to become one of the most integrative fields in all of ecology and evolutionary biology. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Cladistic analyses of molecular (chloroplast DNA restriction site) and morphological data matrices for species of Andira, a genus of Neotropical woody plants, were performed. The molecular data provided considerable phylogenetic resolution but failed to resolve relationships within species groups. The morphological data produced large numbers of equally most-parsimonious trees that yielded an entirely unresolved strict consensus tree. This lack of resolution reflects the small number of macromorphological characters in Andira that display discontinuous variation and thus are suitable for cladistic analysis. A directly combined cladistic analysis resulted in four far more highly resolved equally most-parsimonious trees. In contrast, combining the data sets using consensus techniques yielded poor phylogenetic resolution. The increased resolution of the directly combined analysis is explained by the molecular and morphological characters providing phylogenetic resolution at different hierarchical levels. The utility of the phylogenetic framework provided by this combined analysis is demonstrated by using the phylogeny to study the evolution of dispersal syndromes in Andira. Patterns of morphological variation in Andira are typical of many species-rich genera of woody tropical plants, which are an important component of diversity in tropical vegetation. This example demonstrates that cladistic analysis of combined molecular and morphological data may greatly improve phylogeny reconstruction of these organisms.},

abstract = {Species enter and persist in local communities because of their ecological fit to local conditions, and recently, ecologists have moved from measuring diversity as species richness and evenness, to using measures that reflect species ecological differences. There are two principal approaches for quantifying species ecological differences: functional (trait-based) and phylogenetic pairwise distances between species. Both approaches have produced new ecological insights, yet at the same time methodological issues and assumptions limit them. Traits and phylogeny may provide different, and perhaps complementary, information about species' differences. To adequately test assembly hypotheses, a framework integrating the information provided by traits and phylogenies is required. We propose an intuitive measure for combining functional and phylogenetic pairwise distances, which provides a useful way to assess how functional and phylogenetic distances contribute to understanding patterns of community assembly. Here, we show that both traits and phylogeny inform community assembly patterns in alpine plant communities across an elevation gradient, because they represent complementary information. Differences in historical selection pressures have produced variation in the strength of the trait-phylogeny correlation, and as such, integrating traits and phylogeny can enhance the ability to detect assembly patterns across habitats or environmental gradients.},

Because extinction leaves a characteristic signature in the shape of molecular phylogenetic trees, many studies have used data from extant taxa only to infer extinction rates. This is a promising approach for the large number of taxa for which extinction rates cannot be estimated from the fossil record. Here, I explore the consequences of violating a common assumption made by studies of extinction from phylogenetic data. I show that when diversification rates vary among lineages, simple estimators based on the birth-death process are unable to recover true extinction rates. This is problematic for phylogenetic trees with complete taxon sampling as well as for the simpler case of clades with known age and species richness. Given the ubiquity of variation in diversification rates among lineages and clades, these results suggest that extinction rates should not be estimated in the absence of fossil data.},

First, we present a metric of phylogenetic-abundance evenness that evaluates the relationship between the abundance and the distribution of terminal branch lengths. Second, we calculate an index of hierarchical imbalance of abundances at the clade level encapsulating the distribution of individuals across the nodes in the phylogeny. Third, we develop an index of abundance-weighted evolutionary distinctiveness and generate an entropic index of phylogenetic diversity that captures both information on evolutionary distances and phylogenetic tree topology, and also serves as a basis to evaluate species conservation value. These metrics offer measures of phylogenetic diversity incorporating different community attributes. We compare these new metrics to existing ones, and use them to explore diversity patterns in a typical California annual grassland plant community at the Jasper Ridge biological preserve.},

abstract = {Several theoretical studies have demonstrated the importance of accounting for coalescent stochasticity in phylogeographical studies, however, there are few empirical examples that do so in the context of explicit hypothesis testing. Here, we provide an example from the Idaho giant salamander (Dicamptodon aterrimus) using 118 mtDNA sequences, nearly 2 kb in length. This species is endemic to mesic forests in northern and central Idaho, and several a priori hypotheses have been erected based both on palaeoclimatic grounds and from phylogeographical studies of codistributed amphibians. Phylogenetic analysis of the D. aterrimus data suggests an expansion from a single refugium south of the Salmon River, whereas the inference from nested clade analysis is one of expansion from a single refugium in the Clearwater drainage. Explicit testing of these hypotheses, using geographically structured coalescent simulations to erect null distributions, indicates we can reject expansion from the Clearwater drainage (pCLW = 0.089), but not expansion from the South Fork of the Salmon drainage (pSAL = 0.329). Furthermore, data from codistributed amphibians suggest that there may have been two refugia, and an amova shows that most of the molecular variance partitioned between the Clearwater and the Salmon drainages (54.40{\%}; P {\textless} 0.001) and within drainages (43.61{\%}; P {\textless} 0.001). As a result, we also tested three a priori hypotheses which predicted that both the Clearwater and Salmon drainages functioned as refugia during the late Pleistocene; we could reject (PCORD = 0.019) divergence dates during the Cordilleran glacial maxima [c. 20 000 years before present (ybp)], during the Sangamon interglacial (c. 35 000 ybp; pSANG = 0.032), as well as pre-Pleistocene divergence (c. 1.7 Ma; ppP {\textless} 0.001). Mismatch distributions and Tajima's D within the individual drainages provide further support to recent population expansion. This work demonstrates coalescent stochasticity is an important phenomenon to consider in testing phylogeographical hypotheses, and suggests that analytical methods which fail to sufficiently quantify this uncertainty can lead to false confidence in the conclusions drawn from these methods.},

These results are generally consistent with those derived from other plastid sequence data (rbcL and trnL), but show greater resolution and clade support overall. In particular, the monophyly of subfamily Papilionoideae and at least seven major subclades are well-supported by bootstrap and Bayesian credibility values. These subclades are informally recognized as the Cladrastis clade, genistoid sensu lato, dalbergioid sensu lato, mirbelioid, millettioid, and robinioid clades, and the inverted-repeat-lacking clade (IRLC). The genistoid clade is expanded to include genera such as Poecilanthe, Cyclolobium, Bowdichia, and Diplotropis and thus contains the vast majority of papilionoids known to produce quinolizidine alkaloids. The dalbergioid clade is expanded to include the tribe Amorpheae. The mirbelioids include the tribes Bossiaeeae and Mirbelieae, with Hypocalypteae as its sister group. The millettioids comprise two major subclades that roughly correspond to the tribes Millettieae and Phaseoleae and represent the only major papilionoid clade marked by a macromorphological apomorphy, pseudoracemose inflorescences. The robinioids are expanded to include Sesbania and members of the tribe Loteae. The IRLC, the most species-rich subclade, is sister to the robinioids. Analysis of the matK data consistently resolves but modestly supports a clade comprising papilionoid taxa that accumulate canavanine in the seeds. This suggests a single origin for the biosynthesis of this most commonly produced of the nonprotein amino acids in legumes.},

abstract = {The relationship between Litsea and related genera is currently unclear. Previous molecular studies on these taxa using cpDNA and nrITS were unable to produce well-resolved phylogenetic trees. In this study, we explored the potential of the rpb2 gene as a source of molecular information to better resolve the phylogenetic analysis. Although rpb2 was believed to be a single-copy gene, our cloning results showed that most species examined possessed several copies of these sequences. However, the genetic distance among copies from any one species was low, and these copies always formed monophyletic groups in our molecular trees. Our phylogenetic analyses of rpb2 data resulted in better resolved tree topologies compared to those based on cpDNA or nrITS data. Our results show that monophyly of the genus Litsea is supported only for section Litsea. As a genus, Litsea was shown to be polyphyletic. The genera Actinodaphne and Neolitsea were resolved as monophyletic groups in all analyses. They were also shown to be sisters and closer to the genus Lindera than to the genus Litsea. Our results also revealed that the genus Lindera is not a monophyletic group.},

abstract = {We present phylogenetic analyses of Malpighiales, which are poorly understood with respect to relationships within the order, using sequences from rbcL, atpB, matK and 18SrDNA from 103 genera in 23 families. From several independent and variously combined analyses, a four-gene analysis using all sequence data provided the best resolution, resulting in the single most parsimonious tree. In the Malpighiales [bootstrap support (BS) 100{\%}], more than eight major clades comprising a family or group of families successively diverged, but no clade containing more than six families received over 50{\%} BS. Instead, ten terminal clades that supported close relationships between and among families ({\textgreater}50{\%} BS) were obtained, between, for example, Balanopaceae and Chrysobalanaceae; Lacistemataceae and Salicaceae; and Phyllanthaceae and Picrodendraceae. The monophyly of Euphorbiaceae sens. str. were strongly supported (BS 100{\%}), but its sister group was unclear. Euphorbiaceae sens. str. comprised two basally diverging clades (BS 100{\%}): one leading to the Clutia group (Chaetocarpus, Clutia, Pera and Trigonopleura), and the other leading to the rest of the family. The latter shared a palisadal, instead of a tracheoidal exotegmen as a morphological synapomorphy. While both Acalyphoideae (excluding Dicoelia and the Clutia group) and Euphorbioideae are monophyletic, Crotonoideae were paraphyletic, requiring more comprehensive analyses.},

abstract = {Interspecific variation in chloroplast low molecular weight (cLMW) HSP (heat shock protein) expression was examined with respect to phylogeny, species specific leaf area, chlorophyll fluorescence, and mean environmental conditions within species ranges. Eight species of Ceanothus (Rhamnaceae) were heat shocked for 4 h at several different temperatures. Leaf samples were collected immediately after the heat shock, and cLMW HSP expression was quantified using Western blots. At 45°C species from the subgenus Cerastes had significantly greater cLMW HSP expression than species from the subgenus Ceanothus. Specific leaf area was negatively correlated with cLMW HSP expression after the 45°C heat treatment. In addition, chlorophyll fluorescence (F(v)/F(m)) 1 h after the heat shocks was positively correlated with cLMW HSP expression. Contrary to our prediction, there was no correlation between July maximum temperature within species ranges and cLMW HSP expression. These results suggest that evolutionary differentiation in cLMW HSP expression is associated with leaf physiological parameters and related aspects of life history, yet associations between climatic conditions within species ranges and cLMW HSP expression require further study.},

abstract = {Plant biogeographers have long argued whether plant disjunctions result from vicariance or dispersal. One of the classic patterns of plant disjunction involves New World amphitropical disjuncts, as exemplified by Tiquilia subg. Tiquilia (Boraginaceae). Subgenus Tiquilia forms a heterogeneous group of {\~{}}20 species that is amphitropically distributed in the deserts of North and South America, with four taxa endemic to the Gal{\'{a}}pagos Islands. The current study reconstructs the biogeographic history of subg. Tiquilia in order to explore the origins of New World amphitropical disjunction and of Gal{\'{a}}pagos endemism. A strongly supported phylogeny of the subgenus is estimated using sequence data from matK, ndhF, rps16, ITS, and waxy. Biogeographic analyses using combined and individual marker data sets reveal a complex history of long-distance dispersal in subg. Tiquilia. Biogeographic reconstructions imply a North American origin of the subgenus and its three major lineages and require at least four long-distance dispersal events to explain its current distribution. The South American taxa of subg. Tiquilia result from three independent and nonsimultaneous colonization events, while the monophyly and continental origins of the Gal{\'{a}}pagos endemics are unresolved. This study contributes to a growing body of evidence that intercontinental dispersal has been more common than previously realized.},

abstract = {We investigated the hydraulic properties in relation to soil moisture, leaf habit, and phylogenetic lineage of 17 species of oaks ( Quercus ) that occur sympatrically in northern cen- tral Florida (USA). Leaf area per shoot increased and Huber values (ratio of sapwood area to leaf area) decreased with increasing soil moisture of species' habitats. As a result, maximum hydraulic conductance and maximum transpiration were positively correlated with mean soil moisture when calculated on a sapwood area basis, but not when calculated on a leaf area basis. This reveals the impor- tant role that changes in allometry among closely related species can play in co-ordinating water transport capacity with soil water availability. There were significant differ- ences in specific conductivity between species, but these dif- ferences were not explained by leaf habit or by evolutionary lineage. However, white oaks had significantly smaller aver- age vessel diameters than red oaks or live oaks. Due to their lower Huber values, maximum leaf specific conductivity ( K L ) was higher in evergreen species than in deciduous spe- cies and higher in live oaks than in red oaks or white oaks. There were large differences between species and between evolutionary lineages in freeze–thaw-induced embolism. Deciduous species, on average, showed greater vulnerabil- ity to freezing than evergreen species. This result is strongly influenced by evolutionary lineage. Specifically, white oaks, which are all deciduous, had significantly higher vulnerabil- ity to freezing than live oaks (all evergreen) and red oaks, which include both evergreen and deciduous species. These results highlight the importance of taking evolutionary lin- eage into account in comparative physiological studies.},

abstract = {Phylogenetic analyses based on mtDNA cytochrome b were performed in 42 lizards of the Gymnodactylus darwinii complex from three regions within Brazil's Atlantic Forest. Mainland regions and continental shelf islands in the south-eastern range and mainland areas from the north-east were sampled. The criteria of maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian methods were explored, with the robustness for nodes assessed by bootstrapping (MP and ML) and posterior probabilities (Bayesian searches). By all methods, three distinctive phylogroups were recovered: a south-eastern clade (SE) and two clades from northern regions (NE1 and NE2). The pattern of genetic structure of the major clades coincided with the presence of river systems in the Atlantic Forest, and based on corrected genetic distances between those clades, divergence times were tentatively estimated using mtDNA rates calibrated for squamate reptiles. The putative role of Atlantic Forest rivers in generating differentiation is discussed. We present a hypothesis of species limits for G. darwinii, based on concordant lines of evidence including cytogenetic and mtDNA analyses. Two chromosome races (cytotype A, 2n = 38; and cytotype B, 2n = 40) had distributions concordant with clades SE and NE1 + NE2, respectively. These races are interpreted to be full species on the basis of a number of empirical criteria. {\textcopyright} 2005 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2005, 85, 13–26.},

abstract = {Efficient methods for accurate and meaningful high-throughput plant phenotyping are limiting the development and breeding of stress-tolerant crops. A number of emerging techniques, specifically remote sensing methods, have been identified as promising tools for plant phenotyping. These remote sensing methods can be used to accurately and rapidly relate variations in leaf optical properties with important plant characteristics, such as chemistry, morphology, and photosynthetic properties at the leaf and canopy scales. In this study, we explored the potential to utilize optical ($\lambda$ = 500-2,400 nm) near-surface remote sensing reflectance spectroscopy to evaluate the effects of ozone pollution on photosynthetic capacity of soybean (Glycine max Merr.). The research was conducted at the Soybean Free Air Concentration Enrichment (SoyFACE) facility where we subjected plants to ambient (44 nL L(-1)) and elevated ozone (79-82 nL L(-1) target) concentrations throughout the growing season. Exposure to elevated ozone resulted in a significant loss of productivity, with the ozone-treated plants displaying a {\~{}}30 {\%} average decrease in seed yield. From leaf reflectance data, it was also clear that elevated ozone decreased leaf nitrogen and chlorophyll content as well as the photochemical reflectance index (PRI), an optical indicator of the epoxidation state of xanthophyll cycle pigments and thus physiological status. We assessed the potential to use leaf reflectance properties and partial least-squares regression (PLSR) modeling as an alternative, rapid approach to standard gas exchange for the estimation of the maximum rates of RuBP carboxylation (V c,max), an important parameter describing plant photosynthetic capacity. While we did not find a significant impact of ozone fumigation on V c,max, standardized to a reference temperature of 25 °C, the PLSR approach provided accurate and precise estimates of V c,max across ambient plots and ozone treatments (r (2) = 0.88 and RMSE = 13.4 $\mu$mol m(-2) s(-1)) based only on the variation in leaf optical properties and despite significant variability in leaf nutritional status. The results of this study illustrate the potential for combining the phenotyping methods used here with high-throughput genotyping methods as a promising approach for elucidating the basis for ozone tolerance in sensitive crops.},

The mode ages of the intracontinental crown clades range from 4-6 Myr ago, whereas those of the transcontinental crown clades range from 8-16 Myr ago. Both of these young age estimates are detected despite methodological approaches that bias results toward older ages. Hypotheses that resort to vicariance or continental history to explain continental disjunct distributions are dismissed because they require mostly Palaeogene and older tectonic events.

abstract = {The origin of the eukaryotic genetic apparatus is thought to be central to understanding the evolution of the eukaryotic cell. Disagreement about the source of the relevant genes has spawned competing hypotheses for the origins of the eukaryote nuclear lineage. The iconic rooted 3-domains tree of life shows eukaryotes and archaebacteria as separate groups that share a common ancestor to the exclusion of eubacteria. By contrast, the eocyte hypothesis has eukaryotes originating within the archaebacteria and sharing a common ancestor with a particular group called the Crenarchaeota or eocytes. Here, we have investigated the relative support for each hypothesis from analysis of 53 genes spanning the 3 domains, including essential components of the eukaryotic nucleic acid replication, transcription, and translation apparatus. As an important component of our analysis, we investigated the fit between model and data with respect to composition. Compositional heterogeneity is a pervasive problem for reconstruction of ancient relationships, which, if ignored, can produce an incorrect tree with strong support. To mitigate its effects, we used phylogenetic models that allow for changing nucleotide or amino acid compositions over the tree and data. Our analyses favor a topology that supports the eocyte hypothesis rather than archaebacterial monophyly and the 3-domains tree of life.},

We define and classify the different kinds of zeros that occur in ecological data and describe how they arise: either from 'true zero' or 'false zero' observations. After reviewing recent developments in modelling zero-inflated data sets, we use practical examples to demonstrate how failing to account for the source of zero inflation can reduce our ability to detect relationships in ecological data and at worst lead to incorrect inference. The adoption of methods that explicitly model the sources of zero observations will sharpen insights and improve the robustness of ecological analyses.},

abstract = {A profound global climate shift took place at the Eocene-Oligocene transition ( approximately 33.5 million years ago) when Cretaceous/early Palaeogene greenhouse conditions gave way to icehouse conditions. During this interval, changes in the Earth's orbit and a long-term drop in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations resulted in both the growth of Antarctic ice sheets to approximately their modern size and the appearance of Northern Hemisphere glacial ice. However, palaeoclimatic studies of this interval are contradictory: although some analyses indicate no major climatic changes, others imply cooler temperatures, increased seasonality and/or aridity. Climatic conditions in high northern latitudes over this interval are particularly poorly known. Here we present northern high-latitude terrestrial climate estimates for the Eocene to Oligocene interval, based on bioclimatic analysis of terrestrially derived spore and pollen assemblages preserved in marine sediments from the Norwegian-Greenland Sea. Our data indicate a cooling of approximately 5 degrees C in cold-month (winter) mean temperatures to 0-2 degrees C, and a concomitant increased seasonality before the Oi-1 glaciation event. These data indicate that a cooling component is indeed incorporated in the delta(18)O isotope shift across the Eocene-Oligocene transition. However, the relatively warm summer temperatures at that time mean that continental ice on East Greenland was probably restricted to alpine outlet glaciers.},

abstract = {The assembly of DNA barcode libraries is particularly relevant within species-rich natural communities for which accurate species identifications will enable detailed ecological forensic studies. In addition, well-resolved molecular phylogenies derived from these DNA barcode sequences have the potential to improve investigations of the mechanisms underlying community assembly and functional trait evolution. To date, no studies have effectively applied DNA barcodes sensu strictu in this manner. In this report, we demonstrate that a three-locus DNA barcode when applied to 296 species of woody trees, shrubs, and palms found within the 50-ha Forest Dynamics Plot on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, resulted in {\textgreater}98{\%} correct identifications. These DNA barcode sequences are also used to reconstruct a robust community phylogeny employing a supermatrix method for 281 of the 296 plant species in the plot. The three-locus barcode data were sufficient to reliably reconstruct evolutionary relationships among the plant taxa in the plot that are congruent with the broadly accepted phylogeny of flowering plants (APG II). Earlier work on the phylogenetic structure of the BCI forest dynamics plot employing less resolved phylogenies reveals significant differences in evolutionary and ecological inferences compared with our data and suggests that unresolved community phylogenies may have increased type I and type II errors. These results illustrate how highly resolved phylogenies based on DNA barcode sequence data will enhance research focused on the interface between community ecology and evolution.},

abstract = {Phylogenetic comparative methods thatincorporate intraspecific variability are relatively new and, so far, not especially widely used in empirical studies. In the present short article we will describe a new Bayesian method for fitting evolutionary models to comparative data that incorporates intraspecific variability. This method differs from an existing likelihood-based approach in that it requires no a priori inference about species means and variances; rather it takes phenotypic values from individuals and a phylogenetic tree as input, and then samples species means and variances, along with the parameters of the evolutionary model, from their joint posterior probability distribution. One of the most novel and intriguing attributes of this approach is that jointly sampling the species means with the evolutionary model parameters means that the model and tree can influence our estimates of species mean trait values, not just the reverse. In the present implementation, we first apply this method to the most widely used evolutionary model for continuously valued phenotypic trait data (Brownian motion). However, the general approach has broad applicability, which we illustrate by also fitting the $\lambda$ model, another simple model for quantitative trait evolution on a phylogeny.We test our approach via simulation and by analyzing two empirical datasets obtained from the literature. Finally, we have implemented the methods described herein in a new function for the R statistical computing environment, and this function will be distributed as part of the ‘phytools' R library.},

abstract = {The factors that control biodiversity have been the focus of numerous recent investigations; these include species interactions, speciation, environmental gradients and heterogeneity, all of these operating differently at each observation scale. We used a null model to examine the influence of two forces shaping the community structure of Dactylogyrus species parasitic on roach (Rutilus rutilus) gills: interspecific competition that might prevent the coexistence of the most similar species and environmental filters that might result in the most similar species coexisting together. The study was carried out on two sets of fish from two different localities in the Morava river basin (Czech Republic) to evaluate the consistency of the results across host populations, and at three different scales of observation to test for the scale dependence of assembly rules. In decreasing order, from largest to smallest, the three spatial scales investigated were: the individual fish, the individual gill arch and individual sections of each gill arch. The similarity between pairs of parasite species was measured using three different criteria: (1) phylogeny, (2) quantitative functional traits consisting of parasite size and morphometric measurements of the attachment organ's sclerotized parts and (3) qualitative attributes of reproductive organs. First, our study reveals a strong conservatism of ecological characters for the nine Dactylogyrus parasite species, in particular regarding the attributes of their copulatory organs. Second, our study did not find any limitation of similarity among coexisting Dactylogyrus species due to interspecific competition, irrespective of the scale and the similarity measures considered. Conversely, our results support the niche filtering hypothesis, preventing the co-occurrence of species too dissimilar from one another. This process is particularly apparent at the scale of the individual fish and for functional traits associated with the hard parts of the parasites' attachment organs. In both localities, the Dactylogyrus species that occur on the same fish individuals tend to have similar values for the haptor dimensions. Our study supports previous studies on monogenean parasite communities indicating a weak influence of competition as a structuring force, but it goes a step further by identifying environmental filtering as a key process shaping these communities.},

abstract = {The evolution of lignified xylem allowed for the efficient transport of water under tension, but also exposed the vascular network to the risk of gas emboli and the spread of gas between xylem conduits, thus impeding sap transport to the leaves. A well-known hypothesis proposes that the safety of xylem (its ability to resist embolism formation and spread) should trade off against xylem efficiency (its capacity to transport water). We tested this safety–efficiency hypothesis in branch xylem across 335 angiosperm and 89 gymnosperm species. Safety was considered at three levels: the xylem water potentials where 12{\%}, 50{\%} and 88{\%} of maximal conductivity are lost. Although correlations between safety and efficiency were weak (r 2 {\textless} 0.086), no species had high efficiency and high safety, supporting the idea for a safety–efficiency tradeoff. However, many species had low efficiency and low safety. Species with low efficiency and low safety were weakly associated (r 2 {\textless} 0.02 in most cases) with higher wood density, lower leaf-to sap-wood-area and shorter stature. There appears to be no persuasive explanation for the considerable number of species with both low efficiency and low safety. These species represent a real challenge for understanding the evolution of xylem.},

abstract = {Omphalina basidiolichens are obligate mutualistic associations of a fungus of the genus Omphalina (the exhabitant) and a unicellular green alga of the genus Coccomyxa (the inhabitant). It has been suggested that symbiotic inhabitants have a lower rate of genetic change compared to exhabitants because the latter are more exposed to abiotic environmental variation and competition from other organisms. In order to test this hypothesis we compared substitution rates in the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region (ITS1, 5.8S, ITS2) among fungal species with rates among their respective algal symbionts. To ensure valid comparisons, only taxon pairs (12) with a common evolutionary history were used. On average, substitution rates in the ITS1 portion of Omphalina pairs were 27.5 times higher than rates in the corresponding pairs of Coccomyxa since divergence from their respective ancestor at the base of the Omphalina/Coccomyxa lineage. Substitution rates in the 5.8S and the ITS2 portions were 2.4 and 18.0 times higher, respectively. The highest rate difference (43.0) was found in the ITS1 region. These are, to our knowledge, the highest differences of substitution rates reported for symbiotic organisms. We conclude that the Omphalina model system conforms to the proposed hypothesis of lower substitution rates in the inhabitant, but that the mode of transmission of the inhabitant (vertical versus horizontal) could be a prevailing factor in the regulation of unequal rates of nucleotide substitution between co-evolving symbionts. Our phylogenetic study of Coccomyxa revealed three main lineages within this genus, corresponding to free-living Coccomyxa, individuals isolated from basidiolichens Omphalina and Coccomyxa isolated from ascolichens belonging to the Peltigerales. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

abstract = {Landscape genetics has emerged as a new research area that integrates population genetics, landscape ecology and spatial statistics. Researchers in this field can combine the high resolution of genetic markers with spatial data and a variety of statistical methods to evaluate the role that landscape variables play in shaping genetic diversity and population structure. While interest in this research area is growing rapidly, our ability to fully utilize landscape data, test explicit hypotheses and truly integrate these diverse disciplines has lagged behind. Part of the current challenge in the development of the field of landscape genetics is bridging the communication and knowledge gap between these highly specific and technical disciplines. The goal of this review is to help bridge this gap by exposing geneticists to terminology, sampling methods and analysis techniques widely used in landscape ecology and spatial statistics but rarely addressed in the genetics literature. We offer a definition for the term "landscape genetics", provide an overview of the landscape genetics literature, give guidelines for appropriate sampling design and useful analysis techniques, and discuss future directions in the field. We hope, this review will stimulate increased dialog and enhance interdisciplinary collaborations advancing this exciting new field.},

abstract = {We examined the impact of three forms of dispersal, stepping-stone, normal and leptokurtic, on spatial genetic structure of expanding populations using computer simulations. When dispersal beyond neighbouring demes is allowed, rare long-distance migration leads to the establishment of pocket populations in advance of the main invasion front and results in spatial clustering of genotypes which persists for hundreds of generations. Patchiness is more pronounced when dispersal is leptokurtic as is the case in many animal and plant species. These results are of particular interest because population genetic parameters such as gene flow and effective population size are commonly estimated using gene frequency divergence information assuming equilibrium conditions and island models. We show how the three forms of dispersal during colonization bring about contrasting population genetic structures and how this affects estimates of gene flow. The implications for experimental studies of the spatial dimension of population genetic structure are discussed.},

In this present study, we report on the DNA sequence variation across the genus of 3 microsatellite loci with varying levels of variation. Compared over the species, there was a correlation between the lengths of the microsatellite loci. Interrupts occurred multiple times and did not seem to lead to the death of the microsatellite.

abstract = {The Menispermaceae family contains ca. 72 genera with 450 species that are almost entirely tropical. Its phylogeny at the tribal level has never been examined using molecular data. Here we used DNA sequences of the chloroplast matK gene and trnL-F regions, and the nuclear ITS region to study the delimitation and position of the tribe Menispermeae within the family and its subtribal monophyletic groups. Family-wide phylogenetic analyses of the chloroplast data produced two strongly supported clades. The first clade contains two subclades: Coscinieae including Arcangelisia and Anamirta, and Tinosporeae sensu lato including Fibraureae, supported by morphological characters, such as traits of the cotyledon, stylar scar and embryo. The second clade consists of the tribes Menispermeae sensu DC. and Tiliacoreae Miers. All our analyses surprisingly recognized that tribe Menispermeae is not monophyletic unless tribe Tiliacoreae is included, suggesting that characters of cotyledon and stylar scar are very important for the infrafamilial classification, and that endosperm presence vs. absence was over-emphasized in traditionally tribal division of the family. Our topologies indicate a secondary loss of endosperm. The monophyly of two subtribes of the tribe Menispermeae, Stephaniinae and Cissampelinae, is supported by the cpDNA and ITS data, as well as by morphological characters, including aperture types and shapes, and colpal membrane features of pollen grains, and sepal number of male flowers. The Cocculinae was recognized as a paraphyletic group containing the remaining genera of the tribe Menispermeae. ?? 2007 R??bel Foundation, ETH Z??rich.},

abstract = { The earliest fossil record of Menispermaceae consists of fossil endocarps ( Prototinomiscium ) from the Turonian (Cretaceous, 91 mya) of Central Europe ( Knobloch and Mai 1986 ; Anderson et al. 2005 ). During the Paleocene, Menispermaceae fossils (Canticocculus ) are described from theSentinel Butte Formation near Almont, North Dakota ( Crane et al. 1990 ). Menispermaceae fossils become more common during the Eocene ( Manchester 1999)  Menispermaceae, a dioecious, largely pantropical family of vines and lianas, consists of approximately 70 genera. In this paper, we present phylogenies (derived using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference) based on chloroplast atpB and rbcL sequence data for 42 Menispermaceae genera (60 species) and 15 outgroup genera representing all families in the Ranunculales.   Results of this work confirm that a clade consisting of Berberidaceae and Ranunculaceae is sister to the Menispermaceae and that Menispermaceae is highly supported as monophyletic.  Within Menispermaceae, Menispermum and Sinomenium, two genera with distributions in the Northern Hemisphere, are weakly to moderately supported as sister to all remaining Menispermaceae. Many of the tribes as described by previous workers arc, not monophyletic. To expand both the data and sampling, we combined our atpB and rbcL data with previously published IOU data for two additional analyses: 1) for matching species and 2) for all genera available, including those with either atpB/rbcL or ndhF missing (22{\%} missing data). All trees produced from our three analyses were highly congruent, especially where branch support was high. Four major clades were recovered from all analyses and are informally named. Superimposing our geographical distributions on our atpB/rbcL phylogeny indicates that many well supported clades have distributions on multiple continents, probably due to both vicariance and dispersal. Several previous hypotheses regarding trends in character evolution are tested; our phylogenies suggest that the following are all derived character states within the family: arborescent habit; acrodromous, peltate, Compound, or lobed leaves; absence of condyle and endosperm; smooth endosperm; fused stamens; and tricolpate pollen.},

abstract = {Complex phenotypes can be modeled as networks of component traits connected by genetic, developmental, or functional interactions. Aposematism, which has evolved multiple times in poison frogs (Dendrobatidae), links a warning signal to a chemical defense against predators. Other traits are involved in this complex phenotype. Most aposematic poison frogs are ant specialists, from which they sequester defensive alkaloids. We found that aposematic species have greater aerobic capacity, also related to diet specialization. To characterize the aposematic trait network more fully, we analyzed phylogenetic correlations among its hypothesized components: conspicuousness, chemical defense, diet specialization, body mass, active and resting metabolic rates, and aerobic scope. Conspicuous coloration was correlated with all components except resting metabolism. Structural equation modeling on the basis of trait correlations recovered "aposematism" as one of two latent variables in an integrated phenotypic network, the other being scaling with body mass and physiology ("scale"). Chemical defense and diet specialization were uniquely tied to aposematism whereas conspicuousness was related to scale. The phylogenetic distribution of the aposematic syndrome suggests two scenarios for its evolution: (i) chemical defense and conspicuousness preceded greater aerobic capacity, which supports the increased resource-gathering abilities required of ant-mite diet specialization; and (ii) assuming that prey are patchy, diet specialization and greater aerobic capacity evolved in tandem, and both traits subsequently facilitated the evolution of aposematism.},

abstract = {Epiphytes represent an important element of the tropical flora and are widely distributed across vascular plants. Despite this diversity, however, little is yet known of the evolutionary history, habitat preference, morphological diversity, and biogeographical patterns of epiphytes as a whole. Approximately 10{\%} of cacti are epiphytes inhabiting humid regions, and Rhipsalis represents the largest genus of these. Here we reconstruct relationships among species of the genus Rhipsalis on the basis of plastid and nuclear DNA markers (trnQ-rps16, rpl32-trnL, psbA-trnH, internal transcribed spacers, and malate synthase) and use them as a basis to study the evolution of habit, key morphological features, and the biogeographical history of the genus. Rhipsalis is highly supported as monophyletic, presenting three main lineages. Two lineages are marked by unique floral morphologies and one presents an exclusive stem-shape morphology. In spite of this, neither of these features seems to have been associated with small-scale habit transitions or large-scale transitions through different biogeographical regions. Several lineages of the genus seem to have originated in coastal Brazil and subsequently occupied other tropical forests in South America, North America, Africa, and Asia. These events occurred in relatively recent times, with most of them taking place on terminal branches, thus suggesting recent associations between South American epiphytic flora.},

abstract = {Biodiversity science is unusual in that an emerging paradigm is not based on a specific process, but rather depends largely on stochastic elements, perceived as neutral forces. Here I suggest that these forces, which have been justified, in part, by the concepts of symmetry and equalizing mechanisms, have application to the understanding of stochastic models but do not constitute forces that operate in nature. Another process now regularly classified as a neutral force, limited dispersal, represents a fundamental demographic process that is not neutral with respect to species differences, but rather differs among species in important ways. Finally, I suggest that the dramatic shift in ecological research to focus on neutrality could have a cost in terms of scientific understanding and relevance to real biodiversity threats. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The spectrum runs from quick to slow return on investments of nutrients and dry mass in leaves, and operates largely independently of growth form, plant functional type or biome. Categories along the spectrum would, in general, describe leaf economic variation at the global scale better than plant functional types, because functional types overlap substantially in their leaf traits. Overall, modulation of leaf traits and trait relationships by climate is surprisingly modest, although some striking and significant patterns can be seen. Reliable quantification of the leaf economics spectrum and its interaction with climate will prove valuable for modelling nutrient fluxes and vegetation boundaries under changing land-use and climate.},

abstract = {Geological and climatological processes that have impacted the biota of the Northern Hemisphere during the Tertiary are expected to yield little resolution when area cladograms are compared without taking the timing of diversification into account. In an attempt to establish a set of appropriate phylogenetic comparisons, we distinguished between a Pacific track involving (minimally) China, Japan, and eastern North America but not Europe, and an Atlantic track involving China, Europe, and eastern North America but not Japan (or, in most cases, western North America). Within the two Atlantic‐track taxa considered here—Liquidambar and Cercis—European and North American species are more closely related to one another than they are to the Asian species. Within a set of five Pacific‐track taxa—Hamamelis, Weigela‐Diervilla, Triosteum, Buckleya, and Torreya—we see all possible relationships involving China, Japan, and eastern North America. Estimates of minimum divergence times between Old World and New World lineages, based on molecular and fossil evidence, differ markedly between the two Atlantic‐track clades. Among the Pacific‐track taxa, we find no correlation between pattern of area relationships and estimated divergence times of the Old World–New World disjuncts. Instead, we see a wide range in the timing of these splitting events among and within phylogenetic patterns. Despite the existence of a variety of patterns, inferred ancestral areas and divergence times can be explained by assuming initial diversification within Asia in a number of lineages, followed by iterative trans‐Beringian dispersion and vicariance.},

In this article, this statistic is studied under the Yule and uniform model of phylogenetic trees. The main tool of analysis is a coupling argument with another well-known index called the Sackin statistic. Asymptotics for the mean, variance and covariance of these two statistics are obtained, as well as their limiting joint distribution for large phylogenies. Under the Yule model, the limiting distribution arises as a solution of a functional fixed point equation. Under the uniform model, the limiting distribution is the Airy distribution. The cornerstone of this study is the fact that the probabilistic models for phylogenetic trees are strongly related to the random permutation and the Catalan models for binary search trees.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to attempt to detect a floristic transition in forest along an altitudinal gradient on a mountain side in southern Bahia, Brazil. The study site is located at the east-west transition from tropical moist to semideciduous forests. A belt transect of one hectare (10 × 1000 m) was established running up the slope (from ca. 350 m to 750 m elevation). All included trees and lianas ≥ 5 cm in diameter at breast height were numbered, collected, and measured. Density, dominance, frequency, and importance values (IV) were calculated for each species. We encountered 1400 individuals and 264 species of woody plants in 56 families. Cariniana legalis (Mart.) Kuntze had the highest IV, based on the dominance of a small number of trees. Discocarpus pedicellatus Fiaschi {\&} Cordeiro and Ampelocera glabra Kuhlm. were the most frequent trees, with 90 and 86 individuals respectively. Ninety-six species were represented by a single individual. The Fabaceae and Myrtaceae were the most diverse families with 37 and 31 species respectively. Cluster analysis and correspondence analysis (DCA) revealed that the composition of the forest along the uppermost 30 percent of the transect was distinct from the rest. The lower and upper forests can be considered respectively as semideciduous and moist forests. Although there are some well-marked floristic differences between these forests, both clearly belong to the southern Bahian sector of the Atlantic coastal forests.},

abstract = {Until recently, the study of negative and antagonistic interactions (for example, competition and predation) has dominated our understanding of community structure, maintenance and assembly. Nevertheless, a recent theoretical model suggests that positive interactions (for example, mutualisms) may counterbalance competition, facilitating long-term coexistence even among ecologically undifferentiated species. M{\"{u}}llerian mimics are mutualists that share the costs of predator education and are therefore ideally suited for the investigation of positive and negative interactions in community dynamics. The sole empirical test of this model in a M{\"{u}}llerian mimetic community supports the prediction that positive interactions outweigh the negative effects of spatial overlap (without quantifying resource acquisition). Understanding the role of trophic niche partitioning in facilitating the evolution and stability of M{\"{u}}llerian mimetic communities is now of critical importance, but has yet to be formally investigated. Here we show that resource partitioning and phylogeny determine community structure and outweigh the positive effects of M{\"{u}}llerian mimicry in a species-rich group of neotropical catfishes. From multiple, independent reproductively isolated allopatric communities displaying convergently evolved colour patterns, 92{\%} consist of species that do not compete for resources. Significant differences in phylogenetically conserved traits (snout morphology and body size) were consistently linked to trait-specific resource acquisition. Thus, we report the first evidence, to our knowledge, that competition for trophic resources and phylogeny are pivotal factors in the stable evolution of M{\"{u}}llerian mimicry rings. More generally, our work demonstrates that competition for resources is likely to have a dominant role in the structuring of communities that are simultaneously subject to the effects of both positive and negative interactions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Various expansions or contractions of inverted repeats (IRs) in chloroplast genomes led to fluxes in the IR-LSC (large single copy) junctions. Previous studies revealed that some monocot IRs contain a trnH-rps19 gene cluster, and it has been speculated that this may be an evidence of a duplication event prior to the divergence of monocot lineages. Therefore, we compared the organizations of genes flanking two IR-LSC junctions in 123 angiosperm representatives to uncover the evolutionary dynamics of IR-LSC junctions in basal angiosperms and monocots. RESULTS: The organizations of genes flanking IR-LSC junctions in angiosperms can be classified into three types. Generally each IR of monocots contains a trnH-rps19 gene cluster near the IR-LSC junctions, which differs from those in non-monocot angiosperms. Moreover, IRs expanded more progressively in monocots than in non-monocot angiosperms. IR-LSC junctions commonly occurred at polyA tract or A-rich regions in angiosperms. Our RT-PCR assays indicate that in monocot IRA the trnH-rps19 gene cluster is regulated by two opposing promoters, S10A and psbA. CONCLUSION: Two hypotheses are proposed to account for the evolution of IR expansions in monocots. Based on our observations, the inclusion of a trnH-rps19 cluster in majority of monocot IRs could be reasonably explained by the hypothesis that a DSB event first occurred at IRB and led to the expansion of IRs to trnH, followed by a successive DSB event within IRA and lead to the expansion of IRs to rps19 or to rpl22 so far. This implies that the duplication of trnH-rps19 gene cluster was prior to the diversification of extant monocot lineages. The duplicated trnH genes in the IRB of most monocots and non-monocot angiosperms have distinct fates, which are likely regulated by different expression levels of S10A and S10B promoters. Further study is needed to unravel the evolutionary significance of IR expansion in more recently diverged monocots.},

abstract = {We investigated phylogenetic and biogeographic relationships within Juglans (walnuts), a Tertiary disjunct genus, using 15 species of Juglans and related (Juglandaceae) outgroups. The relationships were analyzed using nucleotide sequences of the chloroplast gene matK and its flanking spacers and of the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) and 5.8S gene of the nuclear ribosomal DNA. The DNA sequences provided 246 informative characters for parsimony analysis. ITS data supported as monophyletic groups the four generic sections, Cardiocaryon, Dioscaryon, Rhysocaryon, and Trachycaryon. Within Rhysocaryon, the temperate black walnuts and the tropical black walnuts were supported as monophyletic groups. When the two data sets were combined, J. cinerea was nested within Cardiocaryon. Combined analysis with published nuclear DNA restriction site data placed J. cinerea in a monophyletic group with Cardiocaryon. These analyses consistently supported Juglans as a monophyletic group and as the sister group to the genus Pterocarya. The results of this work are consistent with the known geological history of Juglans. The fossil record suggests that the butternuts had evolved by the early Oligocene in North America. The presence of butternuts in Eurasia could be the result of migration from North America to Eurasia during the warming trend of the mid Oligocene.},

Freezing or extremely low temperature constitutes a key factor influencing plant growth, development and crop productivity. Plants have evolved a mechanism to enhance tolerance to freezing during exposure to periods of low, but non-freezing temperatures. This phenomenon is called cold acclimation. During cold acclimation, plants develop several mechanisms to minimize potential damages caused by low temperature. Cold response is highly complex process that involves an array of physiological and biochemical modifications. Furthermore, alterations of the expression patterns of many genes, proteins and metabolites in response to cold stress have been reported. Recent studies demonstrate that post-transcriptional and post-translational regulations play a role in the regulation of cold signaling.

abstract = {There has been much recent interest and progress in the characterization of community structure and community assembly processes through the application of phylogenetic methods. To date most focus has been on groups of taxa for which some relevant detail of their ecology is known, for which community composition is reasonably easily quantified and where the temporal scale is such that speciation is not likely to feature. Here, we explore how we might apply a molecular genetic approach to investigate community structure and assembly at broad taxonomic and geographical scales, where we have little knowledge of species ecology, where community composition is not easily quantified, and where speciation is likely to be of some importance. We explore these ideas using the class Collembola as a focal group. Gathering molecular evidence for cryptic diversity suggests that the ubiquity of many species of Collembola across the landscape may belie greater community complexity than would otherwise be assumed. However, this morphologically cryptic species-level diversity poses a challenge for attempts to characterize diversity both within and among local species assemblages. Recent developments in high throughput parallel sequencing technology, combined with mtDNA barcoding, provide an advance that can bring together the fields of phylogenetic and phylogeographic analysis to bear on this problem. Such an approach could be standardized for analyses at any geographical scale for a range of taxonomic groups to quantify the formation and composition of species assemblages.},

abstract = {1.?We sought evidence for limiting similarity, a basic aspect of community structure, in three zones of a saltmarsh. Sampling was conducted at three spatial scales (grains), from a single point up to the scale of several square metres. Twenty-three functional traits, related to the structure of the shoot and root systems and to nutrient status, were measured on each species present, separately in each community. 2.?Patterns of association between plant species were compared with those expected under a null model, to assess whether plants with similar functional traits tended to coexist or to separate, i.e. whether there was environmental filtering or limiting similarity. A patch null model was used, a type that tends to be conservative but that avoids spurious evidence of limiting similarity caused by environmental pseudoreplication. One overall and four univariate test statistics were calculated, to capture possible patterns in trait space whilst minimising the problem of multiple testing. 3.?In the Shrub community, overall evidence for even spacing of co-occurring species in functional-trait space, the pattern expected from the theory of limiting similarity, was seen at the area scale. In univariate tests in that community, there was evidence for even spacing in leaf lobation and leaf succulence, especially at small scales. 4.?In the Rush community, there was significant evidence for limiting similarity in several traits, especially those related to canopy interactions, but also in some root characteristics. However, clustering in other traits, presumably owing to microenvironmental filtering, reduced overall tests for limiting similarity to ?marginal significance? (0.1 {\textgreater} P {\textgreater} 0.05). 5.?In the species-poor and salt-stressed Salt turf, significant departures from the null model were sporadic and not consistent, although chlorophyll characters and leaf nitrogen concentration tended to be clustered. 6.?Synthesis:?There was evidence for niche limitation in two of the communities ? Rush and Shrub ? apparently based on canopy interactions in both cases and perhaps also root interactions in the latter community. Limiting similarity can be an important force in community assembly. However, in situations when it cannot be demonstrated, we do not know whether trait-based competition is absent or whether its signal is overwhelmed by other processes.},

abstract = {Two exposures in Jylland, Denmark, encompassing beds of latest Oligocene to earliest Miocene age (latest Chattian-early Aquitanian) yielded well-preserved palynofloras. The assemblages indicate that Jylland was covered by extensive Taxodiaceae swamp forests in the mid-Cenozoic. Besides a Taxodiaceae-Cupressaceae association, which was overwhelmingly dominant, other common plants in this habitat were Alnus, Nyssa, Betula, Salix, Cyrilla and Myrica. Most of the trees and shrubs are well adapted to swamps and thrive under more or less flooded conditions in modern bald cypress swamps of the southeastern North America. Vegetation composition indicates that a warm-temperate climate prevailed in Denmark during the Oligocene-Miocene transition. According to calculations using the Coexistence Approach, the mean annual temperature during this time span ranged from 15.6 to 16.6 ??C. An increase to 16.5-21.1 ??C is inferred from the palynoflora in the upper part of the section. The earlier, cooler period possibly reflects global cooling associated with the Mi-1 glaciation event at the Oligocene-Miocene boundary. No data from the very coldest part of the Mi-1 event has been recorded, as this is represented by a gravel layer (representing a hiatus) in the lowermost part of the studied succession. The length of the missing time is not known precisely, but is probably in the order of some hundred thousand years. Correlation with the well-established chronostratigraphic and sequence stratigraphic framework for the studied succession reveals that the most distinctive change in palynoflora probably reflects a shift in depositional facies (due to an increase in sea level) rather than direct climatic change. The sea-level rise is herein interpreted to be eustatic and related to melting of Antarctic ice caps at the end of the Mi-1 glaciation event. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Some ecophysiological parameters related to plant performance and fitness (carbon and nitrogen isotope composition and total C and N concentrations; in situ chlorophyll fluorescence measurements) were determined for over 30 species in four habitats bordering the montane Atlantic rain forest of Brazil, along a gradient of altitude and rainfall: a dry coastal forest, two areas of sandy coastal plain vegetation (restingas), and a high altitude campo. There was a considerable diversity of ecophysiological behaviour within and between the functional groups we created based on plant life- forms. For instance, both crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) and C, species were found in most life-forms sampled and throughout all habitats. Despite the variation in rainfall regimes, average overall water-use efficiency was similar between sites, particularly for C, species, while no clear pattern regarding nitrogen-use emerged in this respect. Acute and chronic photoinhibition were found in many species across this gradient, even in CAM plants. However, on average, chronic photoinhibition and lower energy dissipation capacity were more characteristic of plants from the restinga habitats. This suggests that, although plants colonizing these habitats have evolved features to deal with water shortage, adaptation to high light levels has not been fully achieved yet. The ecophysiological performance of some individual species in distinct habitats and in distinct microhabitats within habitats is also discussed. (C) 2001 The Linnean Society of London.},

abstract = {The eastern coast of Brazil is 7000 km long and has been the subject of systematic paleo-sea-level investigations for more than 35 years. More than 1000 samples have been radiocarbon dated, and paleo-sea-level trends have been determined for 14 coastal sectors. These trends have in common a mid-Holocene sea-level maximum (PMT) above present sea-level and a subsequent fall to the present time. The time and elevation of the PMT, the time when relative sea-level rose above present mean sea-level, and the nature of late Holocene sea-level fall can, however, differ significantly. Discrepancies are observed not only between neighboring coastal sectors, but also between different studies in a same coastal sector. This paper discusses all the key radiocarbon-dated samples used to establish regional trends in relative sea-level on the eastern coast of Brazil. It is concluded that although many of the key sea-level indicators are imprecise (in time and space), there is widespread evidence (30{\%} of the data set) for a progressive decline, possibly with uneven rates, of relative sea-level since the end of the PMT. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Negative density-dependent mortality can promote species coexistence through a spacing mechanism that prevents species from becoming too locally abundant. Negative density-dependent seedling mortality can be caused by interactions among seedlings or between seedlings and neighboring adults if the density of neighbors affects the strength of competition or facilitates the attack of natural enemies. We investigated the effects of seedling and adult neighborhoods on the survival of newly recruited seedlings for multiple cohorts of known age from 163 species in Yasunıational Park, Ecuador, an ever-wet, hyper-diverse lowland Amazonian rain forest. At local scales, we found a strong negative impact on first-year survival of conspecific seedling densities and adult abundance in multiple neighborhood sizes and a beneficial effect of a local tree neighborhood that is distantly related to the focal seedling. Once seedlings have survived their first year, they also benefit from a more phylogenetically dispersed seedling neighborhood. Across species, we did not find evidence that rare species have an advantage relative to more common species, or a community compensatory trend. These results suggest that the local biotic neighborhood is a strong influence on early seedling survival for species that range widely in their abundance and life history. These patterns in seedling survival demonstrate the role of density-dependent seedling dynamics in promoting and maintaining diversity in understory seedling assemblages. The assemblage-wide impacts of species abundance distributions may multiply with repeated cycles of recruitment and density-dependent seedling mortality and impact forest diversity or the abundance of individual species over longer time scales.},

abstract = {A paleobotanical and palynological study of Neogene fluvial sediments of sections Salto de Tequendama I and II, located in the area of the high plain of Bogotgt (Cordillera Oriental, Colombia) at 2475 m altitude was carried out. Several other sections of Miocene and Pliocene age were analysed for microfossils and macrofossils and evidence for the uplift of the Cordillera Oriental of Colombia was evaluated. Using modem vegetation zonation, with caution, as a reference, the fossil assemblages are interpreted and the elevation of the site during intervals of the Neogene is inferred. The pollen assemblages of sections Salto de Tequendama I and II include taxa such as Mauritia, Iriartea, Humiriaceae, Amanoa, Virola, Ceiba, indicating a lowland environment. These taxa are presently found on the alluvial plains in lowland areas, e.g. Amazonia. The pollen assemblage of section Salto de Tequendama I contains, in addition to lowland taxa, also montane taxa (e.g. Podocarpus, Clethra, Symplocos, Compositae, Ericaceae), suggesting presence of mountains in the region. Macrofossils representing mainly Hnmiriaceae in section I emphasize the allochthonous character of the plant assemblage. The peaty flood basin deposits of section II show fossil spectra indicative of swamp forest, dominated by Mauritia. The dominance of Cyperaceae and Cyclanthaceae seeds supports the conclusion that the plant assemblages of section II are autochthonous. Biostratigraphical evaluation suggests a Middle Miocene age for the sediments of the sections Salto de Tequendama I and II, although an Early Pliocene age cannot be ruled out. Paleovegetation charateristics suggest a paleoelevation below 700 m, compared to the present elevation of the site at 2475 m. This difference may be explained in terms of climatic change, and tectonic uplift. However, warming during the Miocene and Pliocene accounts at most for 3C, corresponding to a shift of vegetation belts of c. 500 m. The remaining difference in elevation of 1300 m is an approximation for the minimal uplift of the Cordillera Oriental during the Middle Miocene and Pliocene. Plant macrofossils, raainly fruits and seeds, and pollen types new to the study area are described and illustrated.},

abstract = {Shifts in rainfall patterns and increasing temperatures associated with climate change are likely to cause widespread forest decline in regions where droughts are predicted to increase in duration and severity. One primary cause of productivity loss and plant mortality during drought is hydraulic failure. Drought stress creates trapped gas emboli in the water transport system, which reduces the ability of plants to supply water to leaves for photosynthetic gas exchange and can ultimately result in desiccation and mortality. At present we lack a clear picture of how thresholds to hydraulic failure vary across a broad range of species and environments, despite many individual experiments. Here we draw together published and unpublished data on the vulnerability of the transport system to drought-induced embolism for a large number of woody species, with a view to examining the likely consequences of climate change for forest biomes. We show that 70{\%} of 226 forest species from 81 sites worldwide operate with narrow ({\textless}1 megapascal) hydraulic safety margins against injurious levels of drought stress and therefore potentially face long-term reductions in productivity and survival if temperature and aridity increase as predicted for many regions across the globe. Safety margins are largely independent of mean annual precipitation, showing that there is global convergence in the vulnerability of forests to drought, with all forest biomes equally vulnerable to hydraulic failure regardless of their current rainfall environment. These findings provide insight into why drought-induced forest decline is occurring not only in arid regions but also in wet forests not normally considered at drought risk.},

We showed different geographical patterns for genetic diversity, allelic richness and inbreeding levels, estimated using microsatellite data for ten local populations. Ecological suitability was estimating by combining five niche modelling techniques. Genetic diversity tend to follow a central-periphery model and is associated with ecological variables. On the other hand, inbreeding levels may be alternatively explained by isolation processes and habitat fragmentation more related to intense recent human occupation in the southern border of the biome, or by deeper historical patterns in the origin of the populations. Although still suffering from some of the problems of central-periphery analysis (small number of local populations), our analyses show how these patterns can be better investigated and offering a better understanding of the processes structuring genetic diversity within species' geographic ranges.},

abstract = {Extant neotropical rainforest biomes are characterized by a high diversity and abundance of angiosperm trees and vines, high proportions of entire-margined leaves, high proportions of large leaves (larger than 4500 mm2), high abundance of drip tips and a suite of characteristic dominant families: Sapotaceae, Lauraceae, Leguminosae (Fabaceae), Melastomataceae and Palmae (Arecaceae). Our aim is to define parameters of extant rainforests that will allow their recognition in the fossil record of South America and to evaluate all known South American plant fossil assemblages for first evidence and continued presence of those parameters. We ask when did these critical rainforest characters arise? When did vegetative parameters reach the level of abundance that we see in neotropical forests? Also, when do specific lineages become common in neotropical forests? Our review indicates that evidence of neotropical rainforest is exceedingly rare and equivocal before the Palaeocene. Even in the Palaeocene, the only evidence for tropical rainforest in South America is the appearance of moderately high pollen diversity. By contrast, North American sites provide evidence that rainforest leaf physiognomy was established early in the Palaeocene. By the Eocene in South America, several lines of evidence suggest that neotropical rainforests were diverse, physiognomically recognizable as rainforest and taxonomically allied to modern neotropical rainforests. A mismatch of evidence regarding the age of origin between sites of palaeobotanical high diversity and sites of predicted tropical climates should be reconciled with intensified collecting efforts in South America. We identify several lines of promising research that will help to coalesce previously disparate approaches to the origin, longevity and maintenance of high diversity floras of South America.},

abstract = {Ecologists have long observed that consumers can maintain species diversity in communities of their prey. Many theories of how consumers mediate diversity invoke a tradeoff between species' competitive ability and their ability to withstand predation. Under this constraint, the best competitors are also most susceptible to consumers, preventing them from excluding other species. However, empirical evidence for competition-defense tradeoffs is limited and, as such, the mechanisms by which consumers regulate diversity remain uncertain. We performed a meta-analysis of 36 studies to evaluate the prevalence of the competition-defense tradeoff and its role in maintaining diversity in plant communities. We quantified species' responses to experimental resource addition and consumer removal as estimates of competitive ability and resistance to consumers, respectively. With this analysis, we found mixed empirical evidence for a competition-defense tradeoff; in fact, competitive ability tended to be weakly positively correlated with defense overall. However, when present, negative relationships between competitive ability and defense influenced species diversity in the manner predicted by theory. In the minority of communities for which a tradeoff was detected, species evenness was higher, and resource addition and consumer removal reduced diversity. Our analysis reframes the commonly held notion that consumers structure plant communities through a competition-defense tradeoff. Such a tradeoff can maintain diversity when present, but negative correlations between competitive ability and defense were less common than is often assumed. In this respect, this study supports an emerging theoretical paradigm in which predation interacts with competition to both enhance and reduce species diversity.},

abstract = {Comparative methods used to study patterns of evolutionary change in a continuous trait on a phylogeny range from Brownian motion processes to models where the trait is assumed to evolve according to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process. Although these models have proved useful in a variety of contexts, they still do not cover all the scenarios biologists want to examine. For models based on the OU process, model complexity is restricted in current implementations by assuming that the rate of stochastic motion and the strength of selection do not vary among selective regimes. Here, we expand the OU model of adaptive evolution to include models that variously relax the assumption of a constant rate and strength of selection. In its most general form, the methods described here can assign each selective regime a separate trait optimum, a rate of stochastic motion parameter, and a parameter for the strength of selection. We use simulations to show that our models can detect meaningful differences in the evolutionary process, especially with larger sample sizes. We also illustrate our method using an empirical example of genome size evolution within a large flowering plant clade.},

abstract = {I used phenotypic selection analysis to test the prediction from functional and comparative studies of plants that smaller leaves and more efficient water use are adaptive in drier environments. I measured selection gradients on leaf size and instantaneous water-use efficiency (a measure of carbon gain per unit water loss) in experimental populations of Cakile edentula var. lacustris placed into wet abd dry environments in the field. Linear and nonlinear selection differed significantly between the two environments as predicted. WUE was selected to be higher, and leaf area was selected toward a small intermediate optimum, in the dry environment. There was also significant positive correlational selection on WUE and leaf size, suggesting that the optimum leaf size in the dry environment is greater for plants with high WUE. In contrast, neither leaf size nor WUE were selected in the wet environment, though larger leaves resulted in greater vegetative biomass. Path analysis of linear selection gradients found that WUE affected plant fitness primarily because it increased vegetative biomass, as suggested by the hypotheses about the function of physiological traits. These results were not only consistent with the functional hypotheses but also with the observed genetic differentiation in WUE and leaf size between wet and dry site populations.},

abstract = {The changes in phylogenetic composition and structure of communities during succession following disturbance can give us insights into the forces that are shaping communities over time. In abandoned agricultural fields, community composition changes rapidly when a field is plowed, and is thought to reflect a relaxation of competition due to the elimination of dominant species which take time to re-establish. Competition can drive phylogenetic overdispersion, due to phylogenetic conservation of 'niche' traits that allow species to partition resources. Therefore, undisturbed old field communities should exhibit higher phylogenetic dispersion than recently disturbed systems, which should be relatively 'clustered' with respect to phylogenetic relationships. Several measures of phylogenetic structure between plant communities were measured in recently plowed areas and nearby 'undisturbed' sites. There was no difference in the absolute values of these measures between disturbed and 'undisturbed' sites. However, there was a difference in the 'expected' phylogenetic structure between habitats, leading to significantly lower than expected phylogenetic diversity in disturbed plots, and no difference from random expectation in 'undisturbed' plots. This suggests that plant species characteristic of each habitat are fairly evenly distributed on the shared species pool phylogeny, but that once the initial sorting of species into the two habitat types has occurred, the processes operating on them affect each habitat differently. These results were consistent with an analysis of correlation between phylogenetic distance and co-occurrence indices of species pairs in the two habitat types. This study supports the notion that disturbed plots are more clustered than expected, rather than 'undisturbed' plots being more overdispersed, suggesting that disturbed plant communities are being more strongly influenced by environmental filtering of conserved niche traits.},

abstract = {How biological diversity is generated and maintained is a fundamental question in ecology. Ecologists have delineated many mechanisms that can, in principle, favor species coexistence and hence maintain biodiversity. Most such coexistence mechanisms require or imply tradeoffs between different aspects of species performance. However, it remains unknown whether simple functional tradeoffs underlie coexistence mechanisms in diverse natural systems. We show that functional tradeoffs explain species differences in long-term population dynamics that are associated with recovery from low density (and hence coexistence) for a community of winter annual plants in the Sonoran Desert. We develop a new general framework for quantifying the magnitude of coexistence via the storage effect and use this framework to assess the strength of the storage effect in the winter annual community. We then combine a 25-year record of vital rates with morphological and physiological measurements to identify functional differences between species in the growth and reproductive phase of the life cycle that promote storage-effect coexistence. Separation of species along a tradeoff between growth capacity and low-resource tolerance corresponds to differences in demographic responses to environmental variation across years. Growing season precipitation is one critical environmental variable underlying the demographic decoupling of species. These results demonstrate how partially decoupled population dynamics that promote local biodiversity are associated with physiological differences in resource uptake and allocation between species. These results for a relatively simple system demonstrate how long-term community dynamics relate to functional biology, a linkage scientists have long sought for more complex systems.},

We have conducted a range-wide study of genetic diversity in a plant endemic to the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest, Vriesea gigantea (Bromeliaceae), based on a combined data set of nuclear microsatellites and chloroplast (cp) DNA markers typed in 429 plants from 13 populations. The results indicate a strong negative correlation between genetic diversity and population latitude, consistent with historical forest expansion from the northern half of the present distribution range. A deep phylogeographic split exists between the Brazilian states of S{\~{a}}o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro at ca. 23 degrees S latitude, probably reflecting past population isolation within more than one glacial refuge during the climatic changes of the Pleistocene. A comparison of genetic structures at cpDNA and nuclear markers revealed a pollen/seed flow ratio of more than 3:1, thus indicating an important role of the pollinating animals (that is, bats) in shaping the population genetic structure of this species. Diversity was reduced for cpDNA markers in the island populations off the coast, and reduced diversity and increased differentiation were observed for both nuclear and cpDNA at the edges of the species' range. The link between patterns of genetic and species diversity supports the hypothesis that both were shaped by the same biogeographic processes, triggered by the climatic oscillations of the Pleistocene.},

abstract = {The uneven distribution of species richness is a fundamental and unexplained pattern of vertebrate biodiversity. Although species richness in groups like mammals, birds, or teleost fishes is often attributed to accelerated cladogenesis, we lack a quantitative conceptual framework for identifying and comparing the exceptional changes of tempo in vertebrate evolutionary history. We develop MEDUSA, a stepwise approach based upon the Akaike information criterion for detecting multiple shifts in birth and death rates on an incompletely resolved phylogeny. We apply MEDUSA incompletely to a diversity tree summarizing both evolutionary relationships and species richness of 44 major clades of jawed vertebrates. We identify 9 major changes in the tempo of gnathostome diversification; the most significant of these lies at the base of a clade that includes most of the coral-reef associated fishes as well as cichlids and perches. Rate increases also underlie several well recognized tetrapod radiations, including most modern birds, lizards and snakes, ostariophysan fishes, and most eutherian mammals. In addition, we find that large sections of the vertebrate tree exhibit nearly equal rates of origination and extinction, providing some of the first evidence from molecular data for the importance of faunal turnover in shaping biodiversity. Together, these results reveal living vertebrate biodiversity to be the product of volatile turnover punctuated by 6 accelerations responsible for {\textgreater}85{\%} of all species as well as 3 slowdowns that have produced "living fossils." In addition, by revealing the timing of the exceptional pulses of vertebrate diversification as well as the clades that experience them, our diversity tree provides a framework for evaluating particular causal hypotheses of vertebrate radiations.},

abstract = {The assumptions underlying the maximum-parsimony (MP) method of phylogenetic tree reconstruction were intuitively examined by studying the way the method works. Computer simulations were performed to corroborate the intuitive examination. Parsimony appears to involve very stringent assumptions concerning the process of sequence evolution, such as constancy of substitution rates between nucleotides, constancy of rates across nucleotide sites, and equal branch lengths in the tree. For practical data analysis, the requirement of equal branch lengths means similar substitution rates among lineages (the existence of an approximate molecular clock), relatively long interior branches, and also few species in the data. However, a small amount of evolution is neither a necessary nor a sufficient requirement of the method. The difficulties involved in the application of current statistical estimation theory to tree reconstruction were discussed, and it was suggested that the approach proposed by Felsenstein (1981, J. Mol. Evol. 17: 368-376) for topology estimation, as well as its many variations and extensions, differs fundamentally from the maximum likelihood estimation of a conventional statistical parameter. Evidence was presented showing that the Felsenstein approach does not share the asymptotic efficiency of the maximum likelihood estimator of a statistical parameter. Computer simulations were performed to study the probability that MP recovers the true tree under a hierarchy of models of nucleotide substitution; its performance relative to the likelihood method was especially noted. The results appeared to support the intuitive examination of the assumptions underlying MP. When a simple model of nucleotide substitution was assumed to generate data, the probability that MP recovers the true topology could be as high as, or even higher than, that for the likelihood method. When the assumed model became more complex and realistic, e.g., when substitution rates were allowed to differ between nucleotides or across sites, the probability that MP recovers the true topology, and especially its performance relative to that of the likelihood method, generally deteriorates. As the complexity of the process of nucleotide substitution in real sequences is well recognized, the likelihood method appears preferable to parsimony. However, the development of a statistical methodology for the efficient estimation of the tree topology remains a difficult open problem.},

abstract = {The phylogeny of Cercis (Fabaceae) was estimated with DNA sequences of the nuclear ribosomal ITS region and the 3? end of the chloroplast gene ndhF. The combined analysis recovers three trees in which a well supported clade of North American and western Eurasian species is nested within a paraphyletic group of Chinese species. In the single most unambiguously resolved topology from these trees, C. canadensis from eastern North America is more closely related to C. siliquastrum from western Eurasia than to C. occidentalis from western North America. DIVA and character optimizations based on this topology suggest that the initial intercontinental divergence events in Cercis involved mesophytic ancestors. Subsequent inferred intercontinental divergence events involving xerophytic ancestors are consistent with the Madrean- Tethyan hypothesis, which postulates an early Tertiary floristic link between the arid regions of western North America and western Eurasia. Calibration of branch lengths with the fossil record suggests that the North American andwestern Eurasian lineages diverged between 6 and 32 million years ago. The oldest of these values is consistent with both the Madrean- Tethyan hypothesis (?23 million years ago) and dispersion across a North Atlantic land bridge connecting Europe to North America (?13 million years ago), whereas the youngest requires an explanation involving long-distance dispersal.},

abstract = {Woody stems comprise a large biological carbon fraction and determine water transport between roots and leaves; their structure and function can influence both carbon and hydrological cycles. While angiosperm wood anatomy and density determine hydraulic conductivity and mechanical strength, little is known about interrelations across many species. We compiled a global data set comprising two anatomical traits for 3005 woody angiosperms: mean vessel lumen area (Ā) and number per unit area (N). From these, we calculated vessel lumen fraction (F = ĀN) and size to number ratio (S = Ā/N), a new vessel composition index. We examined the extent to which F and S influenced potential sapwood specific stem conductivity (K(S)) and wood density (D; dry mass/fresh volume). F and S varied essentially independently across angiosperms. Variation in K(S) was driven primarily by S, and variation in D was virtually unrelated to F and S. Tissue density outside vessel lumens (D(N)) must predominantly influence D. High S should confer faster K(S) but incur greater freeze-thaw embolism risk. F should also affect K(S), and both F and D(N) should influence mechanical strength, capacitance, and construction costs. Improved theory and quantification are needed to better understand ecological costs and benefits of these three distinct dimensions.},

abstract = {Plants are subjected to extended periods of waterlogging and submersion in the floodplains of Central Amazonia. Several adaptations and growth strategies allow them to survive. In this study, germination and seedling growth of seeds of six tree species from nutrient-rich v??rzea and six from nutrient-poor igap?? were analysed in the Amazon Research Institute (INPA) in Manaus, Brazil. Germination rates and duration were lower in species from v??rzea than from igap??. The cotyledons opened later and had lower longevity in v??rzea, where the environment provides sufficient nutrients to the establishing seedling and there is less need for nutrient supply by the mother plant. Species from v??rzea produced smaller seeds and the seedlings tended to grow less than in igap?? where large-seeded species predominated. Mortality of waterlogged and submerged seedlings was low in all species, except in submerged seedlings of Senna reticulata. Leaf production and shedding was continuous in the v??rzea species, but in the species from igap?? leaves had higher longevity. An explanation for the dynamic leaf phenology in v??rzea might be that this is an adaptation against the high sediment load which covers the leaves and impedes photosynthetic activity. Morphological adaptations to flooding (adventitious roots, lenticels, stem hypertrophy) occurred only in waterlogged seedlings from v??rzea species, maybe as a consequence of the oxygen deficiencies in the rhizosphere caused by the high plant productivity and decomposition in this ecosystem. The production of morphological adaptations might be limited by the low nutrient availability in igap??. The differences in germination and growth in v??rzea and igap?? may be responses to the different nutrient availabilities in the two ecosystems and thus represent different survival strategies. In v??rzea, morphological adaptations which require high nutrient supply allow the plants to maintain growth and photosynthetic activity at high levels, even during waterlogging. Igap?? species have a fast initial growth and constant leaf production, investing in high seed mass, leaf sclerophylly and reduced leaf loss. They tend to remain in a state of rest during flooding. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Invasive species have tremendous detrimental ecological and economic impacts. Climate change may exacerbate species invasions across communities if non-native species are better able to respond to climate changes than native species. Recent evidence indicates that species that respond to climate change by adjusting their phenology (i.e., the timing of seasonal activities, such as flowering) have historically increased in abundance. The extent to which non-native species success is similarly linked to a favorable climate change response, however, remains untested. We analyzed a dataset initiated by the conservationist Henry David Thoreau that documents the long-term phenological response of native and non-native plant species over the last 150 years from Concord, Massachusetts (USA). Our results demonstrate that non-native species, and invasive species in particular, have been far better able to respond to recent climate change by adjusting their flowering time. This demonstrates that climate change has likely played, and may continue to play, an important role in facilitating non-native species naturalization and invasion at the community level.},

abstract = {Community assembly processes are thought to shape the mean, spread, and spacing of functional trait values within communities. Two broad categories of assembly processes have been proposed: first, a habitat filter that restricts the range of viable strategies and second, a partitioning of microsites and/or resources that leads to a limit to the similarity of coexisting species. The strength of both processes may be dependent on conditions at a particular site and may change along an abiotic gradient. We sampled environmental variables and plant communities in 44 plots across the varied topography of a coastal California landscape. We characterized 14 leaf, stem, and root traits for 54 woody plant species, including detailed intraspecific data for two traits with the goal of understanding the connection between traits and assembly processes in a variety of environmental conditions. We examined the within-community mean, range, variance, kurtosis, and other measures of spacing of trait values. In this landscape, there was a topographically mediated gradient in water availability. Across this gradient we observed strong shifts in both the plot-level mean trait values and the variation in trait values within communities. Trends in trait means with the environment were due largely to species turnover, with intraspecific shifts playing a smaller role. Traits associated with a vertical partitioning of light showed a greater range and variance on the wet soils, while nitrogen per area, which is associated with water use efficiency, showed a greater spread on the dry soils. We found strong nonrandom patterns in the trait distributions consistent with expectations based on trait-mediated community assembly. There was a significant reduction in the range of six out of 11 leaf and stem functional trait values relative to a null model. For specific leaf area (SLA) we found a significant even spacing of trait values relative to the null model. For seed size we found a more platykurtic distribution than expected. These results suggest that both a habitat filter and a limit to the similarity of coexisting species can simultaneously shape the distribution of traits and the assembly of local plant communities.},

abstract = {Since the publication of the unified neutral theory in 2001, there has been much discussion of the theory, pro and con. The hypothesis of ecological equivalence is the fundamental yet controversial idea behind neutral theory. Assuming trophically similar species are demographically alike (symmetric) on a per capita basis is only an approximation, but it is equivalent to asking: How many of the patterns of ecological communities are the result of species similarities, rather than of species differences? The strategy behind neutral theory is to see how far one can get with the simplification of assuming ecological equivalence before introducing more complexity. In another paper, I review the empirical evidence that led me to hypothesize ecological equivalence among many of the tree species in the species-rich tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island (BCI). In this paper, I develop a simple model for the evolution of ecological equivalence or niche convergence, using as an example evolution of the suite of life history traits characteristic of shade tolerant tropical tree species. Although the model is simple, the conclusions from it seem likely to be robust. I conclude that ecological equivalence for resource use are likely to evolve easily and often, especially in species-rich communities that are dispersal and recruitment limited. In the case of the BCI forest, tree species are strongly dispersal- and recruitment-limited, not only because of restricted seed dispersal, but also because of low recruitment success due to heavy losses of the seedling stages to predators and pathogens and other abiotic stresses such as drought. These factors and the high species richness of the community strongly reduce the potential for competitive exclusion of functionally equivalent or nearly equivalent species.},

abstract = {Ecological networks of two interacting guilds of species, such as flowering plants and pollinators, are common in nature, and studying their structure can yield insights into their resilience to environmental disturbances. Here we develop analytical methods for exploring the strengths of interactions within bipartite networks consisting of two guilds of phylogenetically related species. We then apply these methods to investigate the resilience of a plant-pollinator community to anticipated climate change. The methods allow the statistical assessment of, for example, whether closely related pollinators are more likely to visit plants with similar relative frequencies, and whether closely related pollinators tend to visit closely related plants. The methods can also incorporate trait information, allowing us to identify which plant traits are likely responsible for attracting different pollinators. These questions are important for our study of 14 prairie plants and their 22 insect pollinators. Over the last 70 years, six of the plants have advanced their flowering, while eight have not. When we experimentally forced earlier flowering times, five of the six advanced-flowering species experienced higher pollinator visitation rates, whereas only one of the eight other species had more visits; this network thus appears resilient to climate change, because those species with advanced flowering have ample pollinators earlier in the season. Using the methods developed here, we show that advanced-flowering plants did not have a distinct pollinator community from the other eight species. Furthermore, pollinator phylogeny did not explain pollinator community composition; closely related pollinators were not more likely to visit the same plant species. However, differences among pollinator communities visiting different plants were explained by plant height, floral color, and symmetry. As a result, closely related plants attracted similar numbers of pollinators. By parsing out characteristics that explain why plants share pollinators, we can identify plant species that likely share a common fate in a changing climate.},

abstract = {Patterns of species richness reflect the balance between speciation and extinction over the evolutionary history of life. These processes are influenced by the size and geographical complexity of regions, conditions of the environment, and attributes of individuals and species. Diversity within clades also depends on age and thus the time available for accumulating species. Estimating rates of diversification is key to understanding how these factors have shaped patterns of species richness. Several approaches to calculating both relative and absolute rates of speciation and extinction within clades are based on phylogenetic reconstructions of evolutionary relationships. As the size and quality of phylogenies increases, these approaches will find broader application. However, phylogeny reconstruction fosters a perceptual bias of continual increase in species richness, and the analysis of primarily large clades produces a data selection bias. Recognizing these biases will encourage the development of more realistic models of diversification and the regulation of species richness. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In contrast to what we know about their great diversity or economic importance, our knowledge at the genomic level of chloroplast genomes (cpDNAs or plastomes) for these crops is limited.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We sequenced the complete genome of the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris cv. Negro Jamapa) chloroplast. The plastome of P. vulgaris is a 150,285 bp circular molecule. It has gene content similar to that of other legume plastomes, but contains two pseudogenes, rpl33 and rps16. A distinct inversion occurred at the junction points of trnH-GUG/rpl14 and rps19/rps8, as in adzuki bean 1. These two pseudogenes and the inversion were confirmed in 10 varieties representing the two domestication centers of the bean. Genomic comparative analysis indicated that inversions generally occur in legume plastomes and the magnitude and localization of insertions/deletions (indels) also vary. The analysis of repeat sequences demonstrated that patterns and sequences of tandem repeats had an important impact on sequence diversification between legume plastomes and tandem repeats did not belong to dispersed repeats. Interestingly, P. vulgaris plastome had higher evolutionary rates of change on both genomic and gene levels than G. max, which could be the consequence of pressure from both mutation and natural selection.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Legume chloroplast genomes are widely diversified in gene content, gene order, indel structure, abundance and localization of repetitive sequences, intracellular sequence exchange and evolutionary rates. The P. vulgaris plastome is a rapidly evolving genome.},

Three of these tests have never had their power assessed before. Our simulations are the first to assess performance under scenarios in which the speciation rates of various lineages can evolve independently. In one of the scenarios explored, rates depend upon the value of an evolving trait, whereas in the other the probability that a species will speciate declines with the time since it last did so. The results indicate that the relative performance of the methods depends upon how the imbalance is generated. Different types of processes lead to different imbalance signatures, i.e., different patterns of imbalance at different depths in the phylogeny, and the measures of tree shape differ in the depth of phylogeny at which they are most sensitive. Relative performance is also affected by tree size but does not appear to depend greatly upon the degree of speciation rate variation among lineages. Two of the indices (Colless's index I(c) and Shao and Sokal's Nmacr;) show reasonable performance throughout, but another (Shao and Sokal's B(2)) is never indicated to be a preferred method. Two tests that do not require completely resolved phylogenies, mean I' and mean I'(10), have reasonable power.},

We compare observations with predictions derived from a neutral model in which habitat is uniform and only dispersal and speciation influence species turnover. We find that beta-diversity is higher in Panama than in western Amazonia and that patterns in both areas are inconsistent with the neutral model. In Panama, habitat variation appears to increase species turnover relative to Amazonia, where unexpectedly low turnover over great distances suggests that population densities of some species are bounded by as yet unidentified processes. At intermediate scales in both regions, observations can be matched by theory, suggesting that dispersal limitation, with speciation, influences species turnover},

The geologic ages of genera of living marine bivalves show a significant break from a smooth exponential distribution, corresponding to the K/Pg boundary. The break reflects a permanent increase in origination rates, intermediate between the Mesozoic rate and the post-extinction recovery pulse. This global rate shift is most clearly seen today in tropical bioprovinces and weakens toward the poles. Coupled with the modern geographic distributions of taxa originating before and after the K/Pg boundary, this spatial pattern indicates that tropical origination rates after the K/Pg event have left a permanent mark on the taxonomic and biogeographic structure of the modern biota, despite the complex Cenozoic history of marine environments.},

abstract = {• Premise of the study: The Cucurbitaceae genus Cayaponia comprises ∼60 species that occur from Uruguay to the southern United States and the Caribbean; C. africana occurs in West Africa and on Madagascar. Pollination is by bees or bats, raising the question of the evolutionary direction and frequency of pollinator shifts. Studies that investigated such shifts in other clades have suggested that bat pollination might be an evolutionary end point. • Methods: Plastid and nuclear DNA sequences were obtained for 50 accessions representing 30 species of Cayaponia and close relatives, and analyses were carried out to test monophyly, infer divergence times, and reconstruct ancestral states for habitat preferences and pollination modes. • Key results: The phylogeny shows that Cayaponia is monophyletic as long as Selysia (a genus with four species from Central and South America) is included. The required nomenclatural transfers are made in this paper. African and Madagascan accessions of C. africana form a clade that is part of a polytomy with Caribbean and South American species, and the inferred divergence time of 2-5 Ma implies a transoceanic dispersal event from the New World to Africa. The ancestral state reconstructions suggest that Cayaponia originated in tropical forests from where open savannas were reached several times and that bee pollination arose from bat pollination, roughly concomitant with the shifts from forests to savanna habitats. • Conclusions: Cayaponia provides the first example of evolutionary transitions from bat to bee pollination as well as another instance of transoceanic dispersal from the New World to Africa.},

abstract = {Caesalpinia sensu lato, in its broadest circumscription, is a pantropical group of c.150 species of trees, shrubs and lianas many of which grow in arid habitats of the Succulent Biome (sensu Schrire et al., 2005), and especially in the seasonally dry tropical forests of Central and South America and the Caribbean. As traditionally circumscribed, Caesalpinia s.l. was one of the largest genera in tribe Caesalpinieae, but seven generic segregates, namely Coulteria, Erythrostemon, Guilandina, Libidibia, Mezoneuron, Poincianella and Tara were reinstated by Lewis (2005), greatly reducing the number of species remaining in Caesalpinia sensu stricto. Nevertheless, doubts remain regarding the monophyly and delimitation of some of these segregate genera, which have not been thoroughly tested using molecular data, and this has hindered the establishment of a comprehensive generic classification of the broader Caesalpinia Group as a whole. Here we present a new phylogeny of the Caesalpinia Group, based on plastid rps16 sequences and dense taxon sampling including 18 of the 21 genera of the Caesalpinia Group and 98 of the c.150 species of Caesalpinia s.l. Our results support the monophyly of five of the genera reinstated by Lewis, but the three other genera (including Caesalpinia s.s.) are non-monophyletic and need to be re-evaluated. Furthermore, three robustly supported newly discovered clades within Caesalpinia s.l. ?? 2013 South African Association of Botanists.},

abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated significant correlations between stem and leaf hydraulic properties when comparing across species within ecological communities. This implies that these traits are co-evolving, but there have been few studies addressing plant water relations within an explicitly evolutionary framework. This study tests for correlated evolution among a suite of plant water-use traits and environmental parameters in seven species of Pereskia (Cactaceae), using phylogenetically independent contrasts. There were significant evolutionary correlations between leaf-specific xylem hydraulic conductivity, Huber Value, leaf stomatal pore index, leaf venation density and leaf size, but none of these traits appeared to be correlated with environmental water availability; only two water relations traits - mid-day leaf water potentials and photosynthetic water use efficiency - correlated with estimates of moisture regime. In Pereskia, it appears that many stem and leaf hydraulic properties thought to be critical to whole-plant water use have not evolved in response to habitat shifts in water availability. This may be because of the extremely conservative stomatal behavior and particular rooting strategy demonstrated by all Pereskia species investigated. These results highlight the need for a lineage-based approach to understand the relative roles of functional traits in ecological adaptation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Molecular clock dates, which place the origin of animal phyla deep in the Precambrian, have been used to reject the hypothesis of a rapid evolutionary radiation of animal phyla supported by the fossil record. One possible explanation of the discrepancy is the potential for fast substitution rates early in the metazoan radiation. However, concerted rate variation, occurring simultaneously in multiple lineages, cannot be detected by "clock tests", and so another way to explore such variation is to look for correlated changes between rates and other biological factors. Here we investigate two possible causes of fast early rates: change in average body size or diversification rate of deep metazoan lineages. RESULTS: For nine genes for phylogenetically independent comparisons between 50 metazoan phyla, orders, and classes, we find a significant correlation between average body size and rate of molecular evolution of mitochondrial genes. The data also indicate that diversification rate may have a positive effect on rates of mitochondrial molecular evolution. CONCLUSION: If average body sizes were significantly smaller in the early history of the Metazoa, and if rates of diversification were much higher, then it is possible that mitochondrial genes have undergone a slow-down in evolutionary rate, which could affect date estimates made from these genes.},

abstract = {There is growing interest in the interplay between ecological interactions among community members and evolutionary processes. At all scales, from genetic variation within populations, through variation across populations, species, and clades, we find feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Ecological interactions are a source of selection that can drive local adaptation and speciation; conversely, how populations evolve in response to such selection can feed back to modify species interactions, communities, and ecological dynamics. We review ecoevolutionary linkages in theoretical and empirical studies in several areas including the following: (1) how intraspecific genetic variation affects communities, (2) multispecies interactions that cause diffuse selection and geographic mosaics of selection, (3) how rapid evolution can generate ecoevolutionary feedback, (4) interpretation of phylogenetic signal in community assembly, and (5) the macroevolutionary consequences of multispecies interactions. We highlight new approaches that may contribute to advances in each of these areas. We also discuss ways of linking these different disciplines, specifically by documenting feedbacks between evolution and ecological communities across multiple scales.},

abstract = {P{\textgreater}Local adaptation is a well-established phenomenon whereby habitat-mediated natural selection drives the differentiation of populations. However, little is known about how specific traits and loci combine to cause local adaptation. Here, we conducted a set of experiments to determine which physiological mechanisms contribute to locally adaptive divergence in salt tolerance between coastal perennial and inland annual ecotypes of Mimulus guttatus. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping was used to discover loci involved in salt spray tolerance and leaf sodium (Na(+)) concentration. To determine whether these QTLs confer fitness in the field, we examined their effects in reciprocal transplant experiments using recombinant inbred lines (RILs). Coastal plants had constitutively higher leaf Na(+) concentrations and greater levels of tissue tolerance, but no difference in osmotic stress tolerance. Three QTLs contributed to salt spray tolerance and two QTLs to leaf Na(+) concentration. All three salt-spray tolerance QTLs had a significant fitness effects at the coastal field site but no effects inland. Leaf Na(+) QTLs had no detectable fitness effects in the field. Physiological results are consistent with adaptation of coastal populations to salt spray and soil salinity. Field results suggest that there may not be trade-offs across habitats for alleles involved in local salt spray adaptations.

A diversity of geomorphological features such as dunes, beaches, beach ridges and swales leads to considerable habitat diversity, characterized by different levels of soil flooding and associated with the 13 different vegetation types. The Myrtaceae is composed of 3500– 5000 species, with some 100 genera. In Brazil, it is one of the most important woody families as regards species richness. The aim of this study was to examine the taxonomy of the Myrtaceae species found in a floristic survey of Marambaia Restinga. There are identification keys and a morphological description of each species with comments on taxonomy, illustrations, flowering and fruiting data, and geographic distribution. A total of 30 species were found in 11 genera belonging to three subtribes (Eugeniinae, Myrciinae and Myrtinae). Blepharocalyx salicifolius, Eugenia rostrata, Eugenia sp., Myrcia richardiana, Plinia ilhensis and Psidium guineense are new records for the Rio de Janeiro sandy coastal plains. The most species-rich genus is Eugenia (13 spp.) and Eugenia sp. is probably a new species. New synonyms are proposed for Eugenia bahiensis and Myrcia richardiana. Based on species distributions, six distribution patterns were detected, as follows: Wide (5 spp.), Extra-Amazonia-West – Atlantic Coast (1 sp.), Eastern-Southern Brazil and neighboring countries (2 spp.), Atlantic Coast Wide (2 spp.), Southeastern-Southern Atlantic Coast (12 spp.) and Rio de Janeiro Endemics (8 spp.).},

This reveals a hotspot within the Brazilian Atlantic forest hotspot. We show that the southern Atlantic forest was climatically unstable relative to the central region, which served as a large climatic refugium for neotropical species in the late Pleistocene.

abstract = {The Rio Grande do Norte State coast, northeastern Brazil, lies in an intraplate region which displays elevated Holocene shorelines, abandoned tidal flats and other intertidal deposits. A field and chronological investigation, which used 48 radiocarbon dates on unaltered mollusk shells, peats, coral reefs, and vermetids in living position and death assemblages encrusted on beachrock, tidal flat and peat deposits, was carried out along two littoral zones, one trending east-west and the other north-south. The sea-level envelope curve for the region indicates at least one sea-level oscillation after the maximum Holocene highstand, which occurred at ???5000 cal. yr BP. This curve shows notable deviations from the mean sea-level curve for the Central Brazilian coast in the early and mid Holocene. However, in general, this envelope curve fits a glacio-isostatic prediction for the area. A significant deviation from this prediction, related to a small sea-level oscillation, occurred from ???2100 to ???1100 cal. yr BP. The comparison between the glacio-isostatic prediction and the sea-level observation enables us to conclude that local events may have disturbed the sea-level record. Minor Holocene sea-level oscillations, which were mainly associated with climate changes or tectonics and superimposed on a major smooth pattern, were observed in South Africa and Australia. But in northeastern Brazil, neotectonic controlled crustal movements or variation in marine and wind currents could provide the answer. The data indicate that local events may have an important role in the history of coastal progradation and retreat. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A common pattern in time-calibrated molecular phylogenies is a signal of rapid diversification early in the history of a radiation. Because the net rate of diversification is the difference between speciation and extinction rates, such "explosive-early" diversification could result either from temporally declining speciation rates or from increasing extinction rates through time. Distinguishing between these alternatives is challenging but important, because these processes likely result from different ecological drivers of diversification. Here we develop a method for estimating speciation and extinction rates that vary continuously through time. By applying this approach to real phylogenies with explosive-early diversification and by modeling features of lineage-accumulation curves under both declining speciation and increasing extinction scenarios, we show that a signal of explosive-early diversification in phylogenies of extant taxa cannot result from increasing extinction and can only be explained by temporally declining speciation rates. Moreover, whenever extinction rates are high, "explosive early" patterns become unobservable, because high extinction quickly erases the signature of even large declines in speciation rates. Although extinction may obscure patterns of evolutionary diversification, these results show that decreasing speciation is often distinguishable from increasing extinction in the numerous molecular phylogenies of radiations that retain a preponderance of early lineages.},

abstract = {We present a unique perspective on the role of historical processes in community assembly by synthesizing analyses of species turnover among communities with environmental data and independent, population genetic-derived estimates of among-community dispersal. We sampled floodplain and terra firme communities of the diverse tree genus Inga (Fabaceae) across a 250-km transect in Amazonian Peru and found patterns of distance-decay in compositional similarity in both habitat types. However, conventional analyses of distance-decay masked a zone of increased species turnover present in the middle of the transect. We estimated past seed dispersal among the same communities by examining geographic plastid DNA variation for eight widespread Inga species and uncovered a population genetic break in the majority of species that is geographically coincident with the zone of increased species turnover. Analyses of these and 12 additional Inga species shared between two communities located on opposite sides of the zone showed that the populations experienced divergence 42,000-612,000 y ago. Our results suggest that the observed distance decay is the result not of environmental gradients or dispersal limitation coupled with ecological drift--as conventionally interpreted under neutral ecological theory--but rather of secondary contact between historically separated communities. Thus, even at this small spatial scale, historical processes seem to significantly impact species' distributions and community assembly. Other documented zones of increased species turnover found in the western Amazon basin or elsewhere may be related to similar historical processes.},

However, intra- and interspecific competition limit the distribution of genotypes. For populations from large parts of the range, relative fitness, compared with the local population, is often highest at the home site. At the edges of the range, this local adaptation may break down. The extent of local adaptation is determined by the balance between gene flow and selection.

abstract = {Physiological limits determine susceptibility to environmental changes, and can be assessed at the individual, population or species/lineage levels. Here I discuss these levels in Drosophila, and consider implications for determining species susceptibility to climate change. Limits at the individual level in Drosophila depend on experimental technique and on the context in which traits are evaluated. At the population level, evidence from selection experiments particularly involving Drosophila melanogaster indicate high levels of heritable variation and evolvability for coping with thermal stresses and aridity. An exception is resistance to high temperatures, which reaches a plateau in selection experiments and has a low heritability/evolvability when temperatures are ramped up to a stressful level. In tropical Drosophila species, populations are limited in their ability to evolve increased desiccation and cold resistance. Population limits can arise from trait and gene interactions but results from different laboratory studies are inconsistent and likely to underestimate the strength of interactions under field conditions. Species and lineage comparisons suggest phylogenetic conservatism for resistance to thermal extremes and other stresses. Plastic responses set individual limits but appear to evolve slowly in Drosophila. There is more species-level variation in lower thermal limits and desiccation resistance compared with upper limits, which might reflect different selection pressures and/or low evolvability. When extremes are considered, tropical Drosophila species do not appear more threatened than temperate species by higher temperatures associated with global warming, contrary to recent conjectures. However, species from the humid tropics may be threatened if they cannot adapt genetically to drier conditions.},

abstract = {Maps of upper-level and surface winds and of surface temperature and precipitation illustrate the results of a sequence of global paleoclimatic simulations spanning the past 21,000 yr for North America. We review (a) the large-scale features of circulation, temperature, and precipitation that appear in the simulations from the NCAR Community Climate Model Version 1 (CCM 1), (b) the implications of the simulated climate for the past continental-scale distributions of three plant taxa (Picea spp., Pseudotsuga menziesii, and Artemisia tridentata), which are broadly representative of the vegetation across the continent, and (c) the potential explanations in terms of atmospheric circulation or surface energy- and water-balance processes for mismatches between the simulations and observations. Most of the broad-scale features of previous paleoclimatic simulations with the NCAR CCM 0 for North America are present in the current simulations. Many of the elements of a conceptual model (based on previous climate simulations) that describes the controls of paleoclimatic variations across North America during the past 21,000 yr are found in simulations reviewed here. These include (1) displacement of the jet stream by the Laurentide Ice Sheet to the south of its present position in both winter and summer, (2) generation of a 'glacial anticyclone' over the ice sheet at the LGM, and the consequent induction of large-scale sinking motions induced over eastern North America, (3) changes in the strength of surface atmospheric circulation features through time, including weakening of the Aleutian low in winter, and strengthening of the eastern Pacific and Bermuda high-pressure systems in summer as the ice sheet decreased in size, (4) development of a 'heat low' at the surface and a strengthened ridge in the upper-atmosphere over the continent at the time of the maximum summer insolation anomaly, (5) increases in summer temperature earlier in regions remote from the ice sheet (these increases appear earlier in the present (CCM 1) simulations than in the previous (CCM 0) ones, however), and (6) continuation of negative winter temperature anomalies into the middle Holocene. In general, simulated surface conditions that are discordant with paleoenvironmental observations can be attributed to the simulation of particular atmospheric circulation patterns (e.g. those that suppress precipitation or advect warm air into a region), with these mismatches amplified in Beringia and the southeastern United States by surface energy- and water-balance processes.},

abstract = {Plants can have positive effects on each other1 . For example, the accumulation of nutrients, provision of shade, amelioration of disturbance, or protection from herbivores by some species can enhance the performance of neighbouring species. Thus the notion that the distributions and abundances of plant species are independent of other species may be inadequate as a theoretical underpinning for understanding species coexistence and diversity2 . But there have been no large-scale experiments designed to examine the generality of positive interactions in plant communities and their importance relative to competition. Here we show that the biomass, growth and reproduction of alpine plant species are higher when other plants are nearby. In an experiment conducted in subalpine and alpine plant communities with 115 species in 11 different mountain ranges, we find that competition generally, but not exclusively, dominates interactions at lower elevations where conditions are less physically stressful. In contrast, at high elevations where abiotic stress is high the interactions among plants are predominantly positive. Furthermore, across all high and low sites positive interactions are more important at sites with low temperatures in the early summer, but competition prevails at warmer sites.},

When demographic models take into account this habitat heterogeneity, the source-sink concept naturally emerges: a local demographic surplus arises in good quality habitats (source), and a local demographic deficit occurs in habitats of poor quality (sink). Within a landscape, a permanent migration of propagules or individuals from source to sink habitats may lead to a stabilization of the overall demographic system. This simple situation, explored in the recent literature, has surprising properties. In particular, it requires a change in our view of classical concepts such as ecological niche and carrying capacity, it can explain the existence and persistence of local maladaptation and it can improve conservation practice.},

abstract = {Cloned genes from tobacco, spinach, and pea were used as hybridization probes to localize 36 protein genes on the chloroplast chromosomes of four legumes.sbd.mung bean, common bean, soybean, and pea. The first three chloroplast DNAs (cpDNAs), all of which retain a large inverted repeat, have an identical gene order with but one exception. A 78 kb segment encompassing nearly the entire large single copy region is inverted in mung bean and common bean relative to soybean and non-legumes. The simplest evolutionary explanation for this difference is a 78 kb inversion, with one endpoint between rps8 and infA and the second between psbA and rpl2. However, we can not rule out a two -step rearrangement (consisting of successive expansion and contraction of the inverted repeat) leading to the relocation of a block of six ribosomal protein genes (rps19-rps8) from one end of the large single copy region to the other. Analysis of gene locations in pea cpDNA, which lacks the large inverted repeat, combined with cross-hybridization studies using 59 clones covering the mung bean genome, leads to a refined picture of the position and nature of the numerous rearrangments previously described in the pea genome. A minimum of eight large inversions are postulated to account for these arrangements. None of these inversions disrupt groups of genes that are transcriptionally linked in angiosperm cpDNA. Rather, the endpoints of inversions are associated with relatively spacer-rich segments of the genome, many of which contain tRNA genes. All of the pea-specific inversions are shown to be positionally distinct from those recently described in a closely related legume, broad bean.},

abstract = {Several techniques, such as concatenation and consensus methods, are available for combining data from multiple loci to produce a single statement of phylogenetic relationships. However, when multiple alleles are sampled from individual species, it becomes more challenging to estimate relationships at the level of species, either because concatenation becomes inappropriate due to conflicts among individual gene trees, or because the species from which multiple alleles have been sampled may not form monophyletic groups in the estimated tree. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model to reconstruct species trees from multipleallele, multilocus sequence data, building on a recently proposed method for estimating species trees from single allele multilocus data. A two-step Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is adopted to estimate the posterior distribution of the species tree. The model is applied to estimate the posterior distribution of species trees for two multiple-allele datasets-yeast (Saccharomyces) and birds (Manacus-manakins). The estimates of the species trees using our method are consistent with those inferred from other methods and genetic markers, but in contrast to other species tree methods, it provides credible regions for the species tree. The Bayesian approach described here provides a powerful framework for statistical testing and integration of population genetics and phylogenetics.},

A more robust phylogeny of Aesculus was constructed by increasing taxon and character sampling to include 42 morphological characters and five DNA regions including rps16, trnHK, matK, ITS, and part of the LEAFY gene. Our analyses revealed three well-supported major lineages in Aesculus. These are sect. Calothyrsus excluding A. californica, sect. Macrothyrsus + A. californica, and sect. Aesculus + sect. Pavia + sect. Parryana. The relationship of sect. Aesculus to sect. Parryana + sect. Pavia is strongly supported and previously unreported. Relationships among the three major clades remained incompletely resolved. Biogeographic and divergence time analyses using DIVA and Multidivtime support a Paleocene origin of Aesculus in eastern Asia and western North America, and showed that the genus subsequently dispersed into eastern North America, Central America, and Europe. Our results support that Aesculus originated as an element of the Paleogene mesophilic flora in the Beringian region with multiple eastward migrations characterizing the early spatial history of this genus. This biogeographic history supports Trans-Beringian migration of plants in the very early Paleogene.},

While indexes of phylogenetic structure, which measure how related species are in a community, provide insight into the processes that shape species coexistence, they fail to pinpoint the phylogenetic scales at which those processes occur. Here, we explore a framework to identify the species and clades responsible for the inferred patterns of phylogenetic structure within a given community. Further, we evaluate how communities that share the nonrandom representation of species from a given clade in the phylogeny are distributed across geography and environmental gradients. Using Ecuadorian hummingbird communities, we found that multiple patterns of phylogenetic structure often occur within a local assemblage. We also identified four geographic regions where species from certain clades exhibit nonrandom representation: the eastern Amazonian lowlands, the western dry lowlands, the Andes at middle elevations, and the Andes at high elevations. The environmental gradients along which changes in the local coexistence of species occurred were mainly elevation, annual precipitation, and seasonality in both temperature and precipitation. Finally, we show how these patterns can be used to generate hypotheses about the processes that allow species coexistence.},

Pitanga plays a role in the maintenance of shrubby coastal ecosystems, especially at disturbed sites, and in ‘restinga' ecosystems, at the interface between low forest and strand vegetation. To investigate the genetic diversity residing within the species, three neighboring populations at a distance of less than 24 km from each other, with varying degrees of human impact, were studied. The level of genetic diversity within and between populations was assessed with amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) methodology. A total of 532 AFLP markers were analyzed in 66 individual trees. The polymorphism level varied from 61.2 to 96{\%} depending on the primer combination used. Intra- and inter-population genetic diversity analysis showed that more than 88{\%} of the variation resided within the populations, with a Gst of 0.123. Nevertheless, using neighbor joining (NJ) and principal component analysis (PCA), on the genetic distance (GD) data, permitted the three analyzed populations to be differentiated.},

abstract = {Although theory has demonstrated rather low levels of gene flow are sufficient to counteract opposing mutation, drift, and selection, widespread recognition of the evolutionary importance of gene flow has come slowly. The perceived role of gene flow as an evolutionary force has vacillated over the last century. In the last few decades, new methods and analyses have demonstrated that plant gene flow rates vary tremendously-from nil to very high-depending on the species and specific populations involved, and sometimes over time for individual populations. In many cases, the measured gene flow rates are evolutionarily significant at distances of hundreds and sometimes thousands of meters, occurring at levels sufficient to counteract drift, spread advantageous alleles, or thwart moderate levels of opposing local selection. Gene flow in plants is likely to often act as a cohesive force, uniting individual plant species into real evolutionary units. Also, gene flow can evolve under natural selection, decreasing or increasing. The fact of frequent, but variable, plant gene flow has important consequences for applied issues in which the presence or absence of gene flow might influence the outcome of a policy, regulatory, or management decision. Examples include the unintended spread of engineered genes, the evolution of invasiveness, and conservation. New data-rich genomic techniques allow closer scrutiny of the role of gene flow in plant evolution. Most plant evolutionists now recognize the importance of gene flow, and it is receiving increased recognition from other areas of plant biology as well.},

Several key areas are reviewed in which phylogenetic information helps to resolve long-standing controversies in community ecology, challenges previous assumptions, and opens new areas of investigation. In particular, studies in phylogenetic community ecology have helped to reveal the multitude of processes driving community assembly and have demonstrated the importance of evolution in the assembly process. Phylogenetic approaches have also increased understanding of the consequences of community interactions for speciation, adaptation and extinction. Finally, phylogenetic community structure and composition holds promise for predicting ecosystem processes and impacts of global change. Major challenges to advancing these areas remain. In particular, determining the extent to which ecologically relevant traits are phylogenetically conserved or convergent, and over what temporal scale, is critical to understanding the causes of community phylogenetic structure and its evolutionary and ecosystem consequences. Harnessing phylogenetic information to understand and forecast changes in diversity and dynamics of communities is a critical step in managing and restoring the Earth's biota in a time of rapid global change.},

abstract = {Adaptive divergence due to habitat differences is thought to play a major role in formation of new species. However it is rarely clear the extent to which individual reproductive isolating barriers related to habitat differentiation contribute to total isolation. Furthermore, it is often difficult to determine the specific environmental variables that drive the evolution of those ecological barriers, and the geographic scale at which habitat-mediated speciation occurs. Here, we address these questions through an analysis of the population structure and reproductive isolation between coastal perennial and inland annual forms of the yellow monkeyflower, Mimulus guttatus. We found substantial morphological and molecular genetic divergence among populations derived from coast and inland habitats. Reciprocal transplant experiments revealed nearly complete reproductive isolation between coast and inland populations mediated by selection against immigrants and flowering time differences, but not postzygotic isolation. Our results suggest that selection against immigrants is a function of adaptations to seasonal drought in inland habitat and to year round soil moisture and salt spray in coastal habitat. We conclude that the coast and inland populations collectively comprise distinct ecological races. Overall, this study suggests that adaptations to widespread habitats can lead to the formation of reproductively isolated species.},

Results from this study confirmed the monophyly of Diospyros with good support and provided a clearer picture of the relationships within the genus than in previous studies. Evidence from phylogenetic analyses suggests that Diospyros colonized New Caledonia multiple times. The four lineages of Diospyros in New Caledonia also differ in their degree of diversification. The molecular data indicate that one lineage is paleoendemic and derived from an ancient Australian species. The other three lineages are more closely related to several Southeast Asian species; two of them are neoendemics, and one has radiated rapidly and recently. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Ecosystem restoration may require returning threatened populations of ecologically pivotal species to near their former abundances, but it is often difficult to estimate historic population size of species that have been heavily exploited. Eastern Pacific gray whales play a key ecological role in their Arctic feeding grounds and are widely thought to have returned to their prewhaling abundance. Recent mortality spikes might signal that the population has reached long-term carrying capacity, but an alternative is that this decline was due to shifting climatic conditions on Arctic feeding grounds. We used a genetic approach to estimate prewhaling abundance of gray whales and report DNA variability at 10 loci that is typical of a population of approximately 76,000-118,000 individuals, approximately three to five times more numerous than today's average census size of 22,000. Coalescent simulations indicate these estimates may include the entire Pacific metapopulation, suggesting that our average measurement of approximately 96,000 individuals was probably distributed between the eastern and currently endangered western Pacific populations. These levels of genetic variation suggest the eastern population is at most at 28-56{\%} of its historical abundance and should be considered depleted. If used to inform management, this would halve acceptable human-caused mortality for this population from 417 to 208 per year. Potentially profound ecosystem impacts may have resulted from a decline from 96,000 gray whales to the current population. At previous levels, gray whales may have seasonally resuspended 700 million cubic meters of sediment, as much as 12 Yukon Rivers, and provided food to a million sea birds.},

Here, we illustrate how phylogenetic information can be relevant to understanding vegetation-atmosphere dynamics at ecosystem or global scales by re-analyzing a data set of carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity in leaves that was used to estimate terrestrial gross primary productivity. The original calculations relied on what appeared to be low CA activity exclusively in C4 grasses, but our analyses indicate that such activity might instead characterize the PACCAD grass lineage, which includes many widespread C3 species. We outline how phylogenetics can guide better taxon sampling of key physiological traits, and discuss how the emerging field of phyloinformatics presents a promising new framework for scaling from organism physiology to global processes. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In response to water limitation, plants have evolved numerous morphological, physiological, and phenological adaptations. In both well-watered and water-limited conditions, we identified considerable natural variation in drought-related whole-plant and leaf-level traits among closely related members of the Mimulus guttatus species complex that occupy a diversity of habitats in the field. The self-fertilizing Mimulus nasutus and serpentine-endemic Mimulus nudatus demonstrated the overall greatest tolerance to soil water limitation, exhibiting the smallest reduction in seed set relative to well-watered conditions. This may be due in part to early flowering, faster fruit development, and low stomatal density. In contrast, flowering of coastal M. guttatus was so delayed that it precluded any seed production in water-limited conditions. This range of phenotypic responses to soil water deficit in Mimulus, coupled with developing genomic resources, holds considerable promise for identifying genomic variation responsible for adaptive responses to soil water availability.},

abstract = {Like the formation of animal species, plant speciation is characterized by the evolution of barriers to genetic exchange between previously interbreeding populations. Prezygotic barriers, which impede mating or fertilization between species, typically contribute more to total reproductive isolation in plants than do postzygotic barriers, in which hybrid offspring are selected against. Adaptive divergence in response to ecological factors such as pollinators and habitat commonly drives the evolution of prezygotic barriers, but the evolutionary forces responsible for the development of intrinsic postzygotic barriers are virtually unknown and frequently result in polymorphism of incompatibility factors within species. Polyploid speciation, in which the entire genome is duplicated, is particularly frequent in plants, perhaps because polyploid plants often exhibit ecological differentiation, local dispersal, high fecundity, perennial life history, and self-fertilization or asexual reproduction. Finally, species richness in plants is correlated with many biological and geohistorical factors, most of which increase ecological opportunities.},

Ancestral charac- ter state reconstructions were compared among three methods (parsimony, maximum likelihood, and stochastic character mapping) using MESQUITE and a full Bayesian method in BAYESTRAITS and inferences of ancestral area distribution were compared between the parsimony-based dispersal-vicariance analysis (DIVA) and a newly developed maximum likelihood (ML) method. Results indicated that among the six inflorescence and fruit char- acters examined, “perfect” binary characters (no homoplasy, no polymorphism within terminals, and no missing data) are little affected by choice of method, while homoplasious characters and missing data are sensitive to methods used. Ancestral areas at deep nodes of the phylogeny are substantially different between DIVA and ML and strikingly different between analyses including and excluding fossils at three deepest nodes. These results, while raising caution in making conclusions on trait evolution and historical biogeography using conventional methods, demonstrate a limitation in our current understanding of character evolution and biogeography. The biogeographic history favored by the ML analyses including fossils suggested the origin and early radiation of Cornus likely occurred in the late Cretaceous and earliest Tertiary in Europe and intercontinental disjunctions in three lineages involved movements across the North Atlantic Land Bridge (BLB) in the early and mid Tertiary. This result is congruent with the role of NALB for post-Eocene migration and in connecting tropical floras in North America and Africa, and in eastern Asia and South America.

abstract = {The phylogeny of 13 species of Myricaceae, the most ancient actinorhizal family involved in a nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with the actinomycete Frankia, was established by the analysis of their rbcL gene and 18S-26S ITS. The phylogenetic position of those species was then compared to their specificity of association with Frankia in their natural habitat and to their nodulation potential determined on greenhouse-grown seedlings. The results showed that Genus Myrica, including M. gale and M. hartwegii, and Genus Comptonia, including C. peregrina, belong to a phylogenetic cluster distinct from the other Myrica species transferred in a new genus, Morella. This grouping parallels the natural specificity of each cluster with Comptonia-Myrica and Morella being nodulated by two phylogenetically divergent clusters of Frankia strains, the Alnus and Elaeagnaceae-infective strains clusters, respectively. Under laboratory conditions, Comptonia and Morella had a nodulation potential larger than under natural conditions. From this study it appears that the Myricaceae are split into two different specificity groups. It can be hypothesized that the early divergence of the genera led to the selection of genetically diverse Frankia strains which is contradictory to the earlier proposal that evolution has proceeded toward narrower promiscuity within the family. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In Amazonian floodplains, plants are subjected to prolonged periodical flooding with a water column of up to 10 m. Seedlings are submerged, except if they establish in the upper parts of the inundation gradient and grow so fast to be able to maintain some leaves above the water surface. The hypothesis of this study is that there are mainly two strategies for seedling establishment in Amazonian floodplains: tolerance of prolonged submergence vs. escape from submergence. Measurements of height increase in relation to floodplain system and nutrient availability, height in the inundation gradient, and seed mass of 31 common species indicated that the two hypothesized strategies enable efficient seedling establishment on different levels in the flooding gradient. Where submergence is unavoidable, on the lower sites in the flooding gradient, seedlings had significantly lower shoot extension than on the higher sites. Large and small seeds produced seedlings with high shoot elongation, enhancing the chances of non-submergence for the seedlings at high elevations. This pattern was evident also within the family of Fabaceae, taking into account the effect of relatedness among species. In igap?? high seed mass compensated the lack of nutrients of the environment. In nutrient-rich v??rzea, nutrients are supplied by the environment and seeds are smaller, but they may produce seedlings which are just as tall. This emphasizes the strong selective pressure for tall seedlings on high elevations in the flooding gradient. It is assumed that the zonation observed in Amazonian floodplains is directly linked to the flooding tolerance and establishment strategy of the seedlings, and less to the tolerance of the adult trees. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Estimates of R(ST), for microsatellites, were higher than those of G(ST), but results of both statistics revealed a close agreement for the genetic structure of the species.

To study species over an entire community, we surveyed trees and measured soil chemistry across climatic and geological gradients in central Panama and then used a unique hierarchical model of species occurrence as a function of rainfall and soil chemistry to circumvent analytical difficulties posed by rare species. The results are a quantitative assessment of the responses of 550 tree species to eight environmental factors, providing a measure of the importance of each factor across the entire tree community. Dry-season intensity and soil phosphorus were the strongest predictors, each affecting the distribution of more than half of the species. Although we anticipated clear-cut responses to dry-season intensity, the finding that many species have pronounced associations with either high or low phosphorus reveals a previously unquantified role for this nutrient in limiting tropical tree distributions. The results provide the data necessary for understanding distributional limits of tree species and predicting future changes in forest composition.},

Here, we develop a theory for plant network scaling that is based on optimal space filling by the vascular system along with trade-offs between hydraulic safety and efficiency. Including these evolutionary drivers leads to predictions for sap flow, the taper of the radii of xylem conduits from trunk to terminal twig, and how the frequency of xylem conduits varies with conduit radius. To test our predictions, we use comprehensive empirical measurements of maple, oak, and pine trees and complementary literature data that we obtained for a wide range of tree species. This robust intra- and interspecific assessment of our botanical network model indicates that the central tendency of observed scaling properties supports our predictions much better than the West, Brown, and Enquist (WBE) or pipe models. Consequently, our model is a more accurate description of vascular architecture than what is given by existing network models and should be used as a baseline to understand and to predict the scaling of individual plants to whole forests. In addition, our model is flexible enough to allow the quantification of species variation around rules for network design. These results suggest that the evolutionary drivers that we propose have been fundamental in determining how physiological processes scale within and across plant species.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding the causes of disparities in species diversity across taxonomic groups and regions is a fundamental aim in evolutionary biology. Addressing these questions is difficult because of the need for densely sampled phylogenies and suitable empirical systems. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we investigate the cichlid fish radiation of Lake Tanganyika and show that per lineage diversification rates have been more than six times slower than in the species flocks of Lakes Victoria and Malawi. The result holds even at peak periods of diversification in Lake Tanganyika, ruling out the age of the lake as an explanation for slow average rates, and is robust to uncertainties over the calibration of cichlid radiations in geological time. Moreover, Lake Tanganyika lineages, irrespective of different biological characteristics (e.g. sexually dichromatic versus sexually monochromatic clades), have diversified at similar rates, falling within typical estimates across a range of plant and animal clades. For example, the mostly sexually dichromatic haplochromines, which have speciated explosively in Lakes Victoria and Malawi, have displayed modest rates in Lake Tanganyika (where they are called Tropheini). CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results show that either the Lake Tanganyika environment is less conducive for cichlid speciation or the remarkable diversifying abilities of the haplochromines were inhibited by the prior occupancy of older radiations. Although the results indicate a dominant role for the environment in shaping cichlid diversification, differences in the timing of diversification among the Tanganyikan tribes indicate that biological differences were still important for the dynamics of species build-up in the lake. While we cannot resolve the timing of the radiation relative to the origin of the lake, because of the lack of robust geological date calibrations for cichlids, our results are consistent with a scenario that the different clades reflect independent adaptive radiations into different broad niches in the lake.},

abstract = {This work analyses and describes seed and embryo morphology of eight Poecilanthe species. Poecilanthe species can be divided in four groups based on seed and embryo characters: (1) P. amazonica-type has overgrown seeds, bears cataphylls on the epicotyl and has an inflexed hypocotyls-root axis; (2) P. effusa-type has two types of trichomes on the epicotyl, which is longer than the hypocotyls-root axis; (3) P. parvilora-type has a visible lens and the raphe runs around three-quarters of the seed circumference; and P. grandiflora-type bears a one-lipped rim aril. Poecilanthe presents a remarkable diversity both in seed and embryo, which reinforces the belief that the genus is not monophyletic. Moreover, our results support the three major clades recognized by a preliminary phylogeny. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 2008, 158, 2492013256.},

This offers enormous potential for investigating the general causes and rates of speciation within clades. To make the most of this potential, we should ideally sample all the species in a higher group, such as a genus, ensure that those species reflect evolutionary entities within the group, and rule out the effects of other processes, such as extinction, as explanations for observed patterns. We discuss recent practical and theoretical advances in this area and outline how future work should benefit from incorporating data from genealogical and phylogeographical scales.},

abstract = {Motivation: Bayesian estimation of phylogeny is based on the posterior probability distribution of trees. Currently, the only numerical method that can effectively approximate posterior probabilities of trees is Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Standard implementations of MCMC can be prone to entrapment in local optima. Metropolis coupled MCMC [(MC)3], a variant of MCMC, allows multiple peaks in the landscape of trees to be more readily explored, but at the cost of increased execution time.Results: This paper presents a parallel algorithm for (MC)3. The proposed parallel algorithm retains the ability to explore multiple peaks in the posterior distribution of trees while maintaining a fast execution time. The algorithm has been implemented using two popular parallel programming models: message passing and shared memory. Performance results indicate nearly linear speed improvement in both programming models for small and large data sets.Availability: MrBayes v3.0 is available at http://morphbank.ebc.uu.se/mrbayes/},

abstract = {How are ecologically diverse organisms added to local assemblages to create the community structure we see today? In general, within a given region or community, a given trait (character state) may either evolve in situ or be added through dispersal after having evolved elsewhere. Here, we develop simple metrics to quantify the relative importance of these processes and then apply them to a case study in Middle American treefrogs. We examined two ecologically important characters (larval habitat and body size) among 39 communities, using phylogenetic and ecological information from 278 species both inside and outside the region. For each character, variation among communities reflects complex patterns of evolution and dispersal. Our results support several general hypotheses about community assembly, which may apply to many other systems: (1) elevation can play an important role in creating patterns of community structure within a region, (2) contrary to expectations, species can invade communities in which species with similar ecological traits are already present, (3) dispersal events tend to occur between areas with similar climatic regimes, and (4) the first lineage to invade a region diversifies the most ecologically, whereas later invasions show limited change.},

abstract = {The origin of species diversity has challenged biologists for over two centuries. Allopatric speciation, the divergence of species resulting from geographical isolation, is well documented. However, sympatric speciation, divergence without geographical isolation, is highly controversial. Claims of sympatric speciation must demonstrate species sympatry, sister relationships, reproductive isolation, and that an earlier allopatric phase is highly unlikely. Here we provide clear support for sympatric speciation in a case study of two species of palm (Arecaceae) on an oceanic island. A large dated phylogenetic tree shows that the two species of Howea, endemic to the remote Lord Howe Island, are sister taxa and diverged from each other well after the island was formed 6.9 million years ago. During fieldwork, we found a substantial disjunction in flowering time that is correlated with soil preference. In addition, a genome scan indicates that few genetic loci are more divergent between the two species than expected under neutrality, a finding consistent with models of sympatric speciation involving disruptive/divergent selection. This case study of sympatric speciation in plants provides an opportunity for refining theoretical models on the origin of species, and new impetus for exploring putative plant and animal examples on oceanic islands.},

abstract = {Introduced and invasive species are major threats native species and communities and, quite naturally, most scientists and managers think of them in terms of ecological problems. However, species introductions are also experiments in evolution, both for the alien species and for the community that they colonize. We focus here on the introduced species because these offer opportunities to study the properties that allow a species to succeed in a novel habitat and the constraints that limit range expansion. Moreover, an increasing body of evidence from diverse taxa suggests that the introduced species often undergo rapid and observable evolutionary change in their new habitat. Evolution requires genetic variation, which may be decreased or expanded during an invasion, and an evolutionary mechanism such as genetic drift or natural selection. In this volume, we seek to understand how natural selection produces adaptive evolution during invasions. Key questions include what is the role of biotic and abiotic stress in driving adaptation, and what is the source of genetic variation in introduced populations.},

abstract = {How will the emerging possibility of inferring ultra-large phylogenies influence our ability to identify shifts in diversification rate? For several large angiosperm clades (Angiospermae, Monocotyledonae, Orchidaceae, Poaceae, Eudicotyledonae, Fabaceae, and Asteraceae), we explore this issue by contrasting two approaches: (1) using small backbone trees with an inferred number of extant species assigned to each terminal clade and (2) using a mega-phylogeny of 55473 seed plant species represented in GenBank. The mega-phylogeny approach assumes that the sample of species in GenBank is at least roughly proportional to the actual species diversity of different lineages, as appears to be the case for many major angiosperm lineages. Using both approaches, we found that diversification rate shifts are not directly associated with the major named clades examined here, with the sole exception of Fabaceae in the GenBank mega-phylogeny. These agreements are encouraging and may support a generality about angiosperm evolution: major shifts in diversification may not be directly associated with major named clades, but rather with clades that are nested not far within these groups. An alternative explanation is that there have been increased extinction rates in early-diverging lineages within these clades. Based on our mega-phylogeny, the shifts in diversification appear to be distributed quite evenly throughout the angiosperms. Mega-phylogenetic studies of diversification hold great promise for revealing new patterns, but we will need to focus more attention on properly specifying null expectation.},

abstract = {Chronograms from molecular dating are increasingly being used to infer rates of diversification and their change over time. A major limitation in such analyses is incomplete species sampling that moreover is usually nonrandom. While the widely used $\gamma$ statistic with the Monte Carlo constant-rates test or the birth-death likelihood analysis with the $\delta$ AICrc test statistic are appropriate for comparing the fit of different diversification models in phylogenies with random species sampling, no objective automated method has been developed for fitting diversification models to nonrandomly sampled phylogenies. Here, we introduce a novel approach, CorSiM, which involves simulating missing splits under a constant rate birth-death model and allows the user to specify whether species sampling in the phylogeny being analyzed is random or nonrandom. The completed trees can be used in subsequent model-fitting analyses. This is fundamentally different from previous diversification rate estimation methods, which were based on null distributions derived from the incomplete trees. CorSiM is automated in an R package and can easily be applied to large data sets. We illustrate the approach in two Araceae clades, one with a random species sampling of 52{\%} and one with a nonrandom sampling of 55{\%}. In the latter clade, the CorSiM approach detects and quantifies an increase in diversification rate, whereas classic approaches prefer a constant rate model; in the former clade, results do not differ among methods (as indeed expected since the classic approaches are valid only for randomly sampled phylogenies). The CorSiM method greatly reduces the type I error in diversification analysis, but type II error remains a methodological problem.},

Ancient hybridization and chloroplast capture may have occurred in the two series in both geographic areas. The two series diverged at 46.3 mya, which is before the formation of the Japanese Sea in the early Miocene (32-18 mya). The Japanese Sea may be the barrier for the seed exchange between the two geographic areas, and was responsible for the formation of the disjunct distribution of section Macrantha between the AS - N and API + N areas, and between eastern Asia and North America.},

abstract = {The tree flora of seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTF) of eastern tropical and subtropical South America was investigated according to two main aspects: (a) the variations in floristic composition were analysed in terms of geographical and climatic variables by performing multivariate analyses on 532 existing floristic checklists; and (b) the links among different seasonally dry forest formations, Amazonian forests and cerrados (woody savannas) were assessed. Analyses were performed at the species, genus and family levels. There was a strong spatial pattern in tree species distribution that only receded and allowed clearer climate-related patterns to arise when either the geographical range was restricted or data were treated at the genus and family levels. Consistent floristic differences occurred between rain and seasonal forests, although these were obscured by strong regional similarities which made the two forest types from the same region closer to each other floristically than they were to their equivalents in different regions. Atlantic rain and seasonal forests were floristically closer to each other than to Amazonian rain forests but north-east rain and seasonal forests were both closer to Amazonian rain forests than each other, though only at the generic and familial levels. Atlantic seasonal forests also share a variable proportion of species with caatingas, cerrados and the chaco, and may represent a transition to these open formations. Increasing periods of water shortage, with increases in soil fertility and temperature are characteristic of a transition from semideciduous to deciduous forests and then to the semi-arid formations, either caatingas (tropical) or chaco forests (subtropical), while increasing fire frequency and decreasing soil fertility lead from seasonal forests to either cerrados (tropical) or southern campos (subtropical). The SDTF vegetation of eastern South America may be classified into three floristic nuclei: caatinga, chaco and Atlantic forest (sensu latissimo). Only the last, however, should be linked consistently to the residual Pleistocenic dry seasonal flora (RPDS). Caatinga and chaco represent the extremes of floristic dissimilarity among the three nuclei, also corresponding to the warm-dry and warm-cool climatic extremes, respectively. In contrast to the caafinga and chaco nuclei, the Atlantic SDTF nucleus is poor in endemic species and is actually a floristic bridge connecting the two drier nuclei to rain forests. Additionally, there are few grounds to recognize the Atlantic nucleus flora as a clearly distinct species assemblage, since there is a striking variation in species composition found throughout its wide geographical range. Nevertheless, there is a group of wide-range species that are found in most regions of the Atlantic nucleus, some of which are also part of the species blend of the caatinga and chaco floras, though the latter plays a much smaller part. We propose that it is precisely this small fraction of the Atlantic nucleus flora that should be identified with the RPDS vegetation.},

abstract = {Codon models of evolution have facilitated the interpretation of selective forces operating on genomes. These models, however, assume a single rate of non-synonymous substitution irrespective of the nature of amino acids being exchanged. Recent developments have shown that models which allow for amino acid pairs to have independent rates of substitution offer improved fit over single rate models. However, these approaches have been limited by the necessity for large alignments in their estimation. An alternative approach is to assume that substitution rates between amino acid pairs can be subdivided into rate classes, dependent on the information content of the alignment. However, given the combinatorially large number of such models, an efficient model search strategy is needed. Here we develop a Genetic Algorithm (GA) method for the estimation of such models. A GA is used to assign amino acid substitution pairs to a series of rate classes, where is estimated from the alignment. Other parameters of the phylogenetic Markov model, including substitution rates, character frequencies and branch lengths are estimated using standard maximum likelihood optimization procedures. We apply the GA to empirical alignments and show improved model fit over existing models of codon evolution. Our results suggest that current models are poor approximations of protein evolution and thus gene and organism specific multi-rate models that incorporate amino acid substitution biases are preferred. We further anticipate that the clustering of amino acid substitution rates into classes will be biologically informative, such that genes with similar functions exhibit similar clustering, and hence this clustering will be useful for the evolutionary fingerprinting of genes.},

We investigated the extent to which the climatic origins of populations from four live oak species (Quercus series Virentes) were associated with freezing tolerance and growth rate, and whether species fitted a model of locally adapted populations, each with narrow climatic tolerances, or of broadly adapted populations with wide climatic tolerances. • Acorns from populations of four species across a tropical-temperate gradient were grown under common tropical and temperate conditions. Growth rate, seed mass, and leaf and stem freezing traits were compared with source minimum temperatures. • Maximum growth rates under tropical conditions were negatively correlated with freezing tolerance under temperate conditions. The minimum source temperature predicted the freezing tolerance of populations under temperate conditions. The tropical species Q. oleoides was differentiated from the three temperate species, and variation among species was greater than among populations. • The trade-off between freezing tolerance and growth rate supports the range limit hypothesis. Limited variation within species indicates that the distributions of species may be driven more strongly by broad climatic factors than by highly local conditions.},

abstract = {Phylogenetic relationships among 40 of the 43 recognized species of Fraxinus L. (Oleaceae) were estimated on the basis of 106 nuclear ribosomal ITS sequences. ITS trees resulting from maximum likelihood (ML), maximum parsimony (MP) and Bayesian inference (BI) are congruent and identify six distinct lineages. These clades allow establishing sections with high molecular and morphological support. The basal resolution generally has low ML bootstrap and MP jackknife support, but the Bayesian posterior probabilities are high for certain relationships. An independent data set of combined sequences from the chloroplast rps16 and trnL-F regions contains few informative sites but corroborate most of the relationships in the ITS tree. The molecular phylogeny is discussed in the light of morphological and other data and a revised infrageneric classification with six sections are presented. The subgenera and subsections are abandoned and the section Pauciflorae is a new combination. Fraxinus quadrangulata and Fraxinus anomala are united with Fraxinus dipetala in the section Dipetalae and Fraxinus platypoda is transferred to the section Fraxinus. Fraxinus chiisanensis, Fraxinus spaethiana and Fraxinus cuspidata are treated as incertae sedis. A sectional key is given, together with a systematic list of the 43 recognized species, with common synonyms and distribution. Breeding system and other traits mapped on the phylogeny show that dioecy has three separate origins, and in each case followed after the transition from insect to wind pollination. In one instance dioecy evolved from hermaphroditism via androdioecy and twice via polygamy.

abstract = {Divergent natural selection drives evolutionary diversification. It creates phenotypic diversity by favoring developmental plasticity within populations or genetic differentiation and local adaptation among populations. We investigated phenotypic and genetic divergence in the livebearing fish Poecilia mexicana along two abiotic environmental gradients. These fish typically inhabit nonsulfidic surface rivers, but also colonized sulfidic and cave habitats. We assessed phenotypic variation among a factorial combination of habitat types using geometric and traditional morphometrics, and genetic divergence using quantitative and molecular genetic analyses. Fish in caves (sulfidic or not) exhibited reduced eyes and slender bodies. Fish from sulfidic habitats (surface or cave) exhibited larger heads and longer gill filaments. Common-garden rearing suggested that these morphological differences are partly heritable. Population genetic analyses using microsatellites as well as cytochrome b gene sequences indicate high population differentiation over small spatial scale and very low rates of gene flow, especially among different habitat types. This suggests that divergent environmental conditions constitute barriers to gene flow. Strong molecular divergence over short distances as well as phenotypic and quantitative genetic divergence across habitats in directions classic to fish ecomorphology suggest that divergent selection is structuring phenotypic variation in this system.},

abstract = {Understanding the processes maintaining species diversity is a central problem in ecology, with implications for the conservation and management of ecosystems. Although biologists often assume that trait differences between competitors promote diversity, empirical evidence connecting functional traits to the niche differences that stabilize species coexistence is rare. Obtaining such evidence is critical because traits also underlie the average fitness differences driving competitive exclusion, and this complicates efforts to infer community dynamics from phenotypic patterns. We coupled field-parameterized mathematical models of competition between 102 pairs of annual plants with detailed sampling of leaf, seed, root, and whole-plant functional traits to relate phenotypic differences to stabilizing niche and average fitness differences. Single functional traits were often well correlated with average fitness differences between species, indicating that competitive dominance was associated with late phenology, deep rooting, and several other traits. In contrast, single functional traits were poorly correlated with the stabilizing niche differences that promote coexistence. Niche differences could only be described by combinations of traits, corresponding to differentiation between species in multiple ecological dimensions. In addition, several traits were associated with both fitness differences and stabilizing niche differences. These complex relationships between phenotypic differences and the dynamics of competing species argue against the simple use of single functional traits to infer community assembly processes but lay the groundwork for a theoretically justified trait-based community ecology.},

abstract = {Evolutionary biologists often wish to explore the impact of a particular historical event (e.g., the origin of a novel morphological trait, an episode of biogeographic dispersal, or the onset of an ecological association) on rates of diversification (speciation minus extinction). We describe a Bayesian approach for evaluating the correlation between such events and differential rates of diversification that relies on cross-validation predictive densities. This approach exploits estimates of the marginal posterior probability for the rate of diversification (in the unaffected part of the tree) and the marginal probability for the timing of the event to generate a predictive distribution of species diversity that would be expected had the event not occurred. The realized species diversity can then be compared to this predictive diversity distribution to assess whether rates of diversification associated with the event are significantly higher or lower than expected. Although simple, this Bayesian approach provides a robust inference framework that accommodates various sources of uncertainty, including error associated with estimates of divergence times, diversification-rate parameters, and event history. Furthermore, the proposed approach is relatively flexible, allowing exploration of various types of events (including changes in discrete morphological traits, episodes of biogeographic movement, etc.) under both hypothesis-testing and data-exploration inference scenarios. Importantly, the cross-validation predictive densities approach facilitates evaluation of both replicated and unique historical events. We demonstrate this approach with empirical examples concerning the impact of morphological and biogeographic events on rates of diversification in Adoxaceae and Lupinus, respectively.},

abstract = {Most phylogenetically based statistical methods for the analysis of quantitative or continuously varying phenotypic traits assume that variation within species is absent or at least negligible, which is unrealistic for many traits. Within-species variation has several components. Differences among populations of the same species may represent either phylogenetic divergence or direct effects of environmental factors that differ among populations (phenotypic plasticity). Within-population variation also contributes to within-species variation and includes sampling variation, instrument-related error, low repeatability caused by fluctuations in behavioral or physiological state, variation related to age, sex, season, or time of day, and individual variation within such categories. Here we develop techniques for analyzing phylogenetically correlated data to include within-species variation, or "measurement error" as it is often termed in the statistical literature. We derive methods for (i) univariate analyses, including measurement of "phylogenetic signal," (ii) correlation and principal components analysis for multiple traits, (iii) multiple regression, and (iv) inference of "functional relations," such as reduced major axis (RMA) regression. The methods are capable of incorporating measurement error that differs for each data point (mean value for a species or population), but they can be modified for special cases in which less is known about measurement error (e.g., when one is willing to assume something about the ratio of measurement error in two traits). We show that failure to incorporate measurement error can lead to both biased and imprecise (unduly uncertain) parameter estimates. Even previous methods that are thought to account for measurement error, such as conventional RMA regression, can be improved by explicitly incorporating measurement error and phylogenetic correlation. We illustrate these methods with examples and simulations and provide Matlab programs.},

The number of studies employing this broad approach has increased to the point where comparison of their results can now be used to highlight successes and deficiencies in the approach, and to detect emerging patterns in community organization. We review studies of the phylogenetic structure of communities of different major taxa and trophic levels, across different spatial and phylogenetic scales, and using different metrics and null models. Twenty-three of 39 studies (59{\%}) find evidence for phylogenetic clustering in contemporary communities, but terrestrial and/or plant systems are heavily over-represented among published studies. Experimental investigations, although uncommon at present, hold promise for unravelling mechanisms underlying the phylogenetic community structure patterns observed in community surveys. We discuss the relationship between metrics of phylogenetic clustering and tree balance and explore the various emerging biases in taxonomy and pitfalls of scale. Finally, we look beyond one-dimensional metrics of phylogenetic structure towards multivariate descriptors that better capture the variety of ecological behaviours likely to be exhibited in communities of species with hundreds of millions of years of independent evolution.},

abstract = {The oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition of soil water ($\delta$18Ow and $\delta$Dw hereafter) reflect the history of water through processes such as source evaporation, precipitation and vapor recycling. Temperature, humidity, evaporation, and post-condensation processes can affect $\delta$18Ow and $\delta$Dw. As such, isotope proxy records are often limited in their ability to constrain paleoclimate, paleoecology or paleoelevation without independently corroborating data. Smectite preserves both the hydrogen and oxygen isotope signature of parent water, and therefore provides critical insight into meteoric water line relationships and paleotemperature. Here, we use in situ pedogenic smectite $\delta$18O and $\delta$D records to characterize the evolution of the hydrologic cycle in Cenozoic western North America. We incorporate 192 samples, 119 of which are previously unpublished, from 11 Cenozoic basins representing a range of environments in the Basin and Range, Rocky Mountains and Great Plains. Our results indicate that the processes controlling smectite isotopic compositions vary both regionally and temporally. In some localities such as Oligocene to Pleistocene western Nebraska, change in temperature is the primary control on smectite isotopic composition. In other basins such as in Miocene Trapper Creek, ID, isotope values lie along the meteoric water line, suggesting change in meteoric water composition is responsible for the variation. In most basins, especially those in the Neogene Basin and Range, smectite line slope suggests either evaporation of previously meteoric water or a combination of change in paleotemperature and meteoric water composition. Smectite geothermometry suggests mineral formation temperatures of 30-40°C in the Middle Miocene in the Rocky Mountains, Great Plains and Basin and Range, and a decrease of 10-15°C since the Middle Miocene Climatic Optimum, consistent with clumped isotope and paleofloral temperature estimates. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {1.Attempts at explaining range limits of temperate tree species still rest on correlations with climatic data that lack a physiological justification. Here we present a synthesis of a multidisciplinary project that offers mechanistic explantions. Employing climatology, biogeography, dendrology, population and reproduction biology, stress physiology and phenology, we combine results from in situ elevational (Swiss Alps) and latitudinal (Alps versus Scandinavia) comparisons, from reciprocal common garden and phytotron studies for 8 European broadleaf tree species. 2.We show that unlike for low stature plants, tree canopy temperatures can be predicted from weather station data, and that low temperature extremes in winter do not explain range limits. At the current low temperature range limit, all species recruit well. Transplants revealed that the local environment rather than elevation of seed origin dominates growth and phenology. Tree ring width at the range limit is not related to season length, but to growing season temperature, with no evidence of carbon shortage. Bud break and leaf emergence in adults trees are timed in such a way that the probability of freezing damage is almost zero, with a uniform safety margin across elevations and taxa. More freezing-resistant species flush earlier than less resistant species. 3.Synthesis: we conclude that the range limits of the examined tree species are set by the interactive influence of freezing resistance in spring, phenology settings, and the time required to mature tissue. Microevolution of spring phenology compromises between demands set by freezing resistance of young, immature tissue and season length requirements related to autumnal tissue maturation.

Aralia cordata from eastern Asia did not form a species-pair relationship with the eastern North American A. racemosa. The two subspecies of A. racemosa formed a monophyletic group.

Furthermore, a lack of correlation between sequence divergence values and phylogenetic positions was observed, suggesting the importance of a phylogenetic framework in biogeographic analyses.},

abstract = {We study the consequences of asymmetric dispersal rates (e. g., due to wind or current) for adaptive evolution in a system of two habitat patches. Asymmetric dispersal rates can lead to overcrowding of the "downstream" habitat, resulting in a source-sink population structure in the absence of intrinsic quality differences between habitats or can even cause an intrinsically better habitat to function as a sink. Source-sink population structure due to asymmetric dispersal rates has similar consequences for adaptive evolution as a source-sink structure due to habitat quality differences: natural selection tends to be biased toward the source habitat. We demonstrate this for two models of adaptive evolution: invasion of a rare allele that improves fitness in one habitat but reduces it in the other and antagonistic selection on a quantitative trait determined by five additive loci. If a habitat can sustain a population without immigration, the conditions for adaptation to that habitat are most favorable if there is little or no immigration from the other habitat; the influence of emigration depends on the magnitude of the allelic effects involved and other parameters. If, however, the population is initially unable to persist in a given habitat without immigration, our model predicts that the population will be most likely to adapt to that habitat if the dispersal rates in both directions are high. Our results highlight the general message that the effect of gene flow upon local adaptation should depend profoundly on the demographic context of selection.},

abstract = {The concepts of niche conservatism and adaptive radiation have played central roles in the study of evolution and ecological diversification. With respect to phenotypic evolution, the two processes may be seen as opposite ends of a spectrum; however, there is no straightforward method for the comparative analysis of trait evolution that will identify these contrasting scenarios. Analysis of the rate of phenotypic evolution plays an important role in this context and merits increased attention. In this article, independent contrasts are used to estimate rates of evolution for continuous traits under a Brownian motion model of evolution. A unit for the rate of phenotypic diversification is introduced: the felsen, in honor of J. Felsenstein, is defined as an increase of one unit per million years in the variance among sister taxa of ln-transformed trait values. The use of a standardized unit of measurement facilitates comparisons among clades and traits. Rates of diversification of three functional traits (plant height, leaf size, and seed size) were estimated for four to six woody plant clades (Acer, Aesculus, Ceanothus, Arbutoideae, Hawaiian lobeliads, and the silversword alliance) for which calibrated phylogenies were available. For height and leaf size, rates were two to approximately 300 times greater in the Hawaiian silversword alliance than in the other clades considered. These results highlight the value of direct estimates of rates of trait evolution for comparative analysis of adaptive radiation, niche conservatism, and trait diversification.},

Why then is SLA more frequently used as a predictor of soil fertility than LDMC?$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: SLA, LDMC and LT were measured and leaf density (LD) estimated for almost 2000 species, and the capacity of LD to predict LDMC was examined, as was the relative contribution of LDMC and LT to the expression of SLA. Subsequently, the relationships between SLA, LDMC and LT with respect to soil fertility and shade were described.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nKEY RESULTS: Although LD is strongly related to LDMC, and LDMC and LT each contribute equally to the expression of SLA, the exact relationships differ between ecological groupings. LDMC predicts leaf nitrogen content and soil fertility but, because LT primarily varies with light intensity, SLA increases in response to both increased shade and increased fertility.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Gradients of soil fertility are frequently also gradients of biomass accumulation with reduced irradiance lower in the canopy. Therefore, SLA, which includes both fertility and shade components, may often discriminate better between communities or treatments than LDMC. However, LDMC should always be the preferred trait for assessing gradients of soil fertility uncoupled from shade. Nevertheless, because leaves multitask, individual leaf traits do not necessarily exhibit exact functional equivalence between species. In consequence, rather than using a single stand-alone predictor, multivariate analyses using several leaf traits is recommended.},

abstract = {The study of morphological evolution after the inferred origin of active flight homologous with that in Aves has historically been characterized by an emphasis on anatomically disjunct, mosaic patterns of change. Relatively few prior studies have used discrete morphological character data in a phylogenetic context to quantitatively investigate morphological evolution or mosaic evolution in particular. One such previously employed method, which used summed unambiguously optimized synapomorphies, has been the basis for proposing disassociated and sequential "modernizing" or "fine-tuning" of pectoral and then pelvic locomotor systems after the origin of flight ("pectoral early-pelvic late" hypothesis). We use one of the most inclusive phylogenetic data sets of basal birds to investigate properties of this method and to consider the application of a Bayesian phylogenetic approach. Bayes factor and statistical comparisons of branch length estimates were used to evaluate support for a mosaic pattern of character change and the specific pectoral early-pelvic late hypothesis. Partitions were defined a priori based on anatomical subregion (e.g., pelvic, pectoral) and were based on those hypothesized using the summed synapomorphy approach. We compare 80 models all implementing the M(k) model for morphological data but varying in the number of anatomical subregion partitions, the models for among-partition rate variation and among-character rate variation, as well as the branch length prior. Statistical analysis reveals that partitioning data by anatomical subregion, independently estimating branch lengths for partitioned data, and use of shared or per partition gamma-shaped among-character rate distribution significantly increases estimated model likelihoods. Simulation studies reveal that partitioned models where characters are randomly assigned perform significantly worse than both the observed model and the single-partition equal-rate model, suggesting that only partitioning by anatomical subregion increases model performance. The preference for models with partitions defined a priori by anatomical subregion is consistent with a disjunctive pattern of character change for the data set investigated and may have implications for parameterization of Bayesian analyses of morphological data more generally. Statistical tests of differences in estimated branch lengths from the pectoral and pelvic partitions do not support the specific pectoral early-pelvic late hypothesis proposed from the summed synapomorphy approach; however, results suggest limited support for some pectoral branch lengths being significantly longer only early at/after the origin of flight.},

abstract = {$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* Second-growth forests account for 40{\%} of the terrestrial forest carbon sink and represent the dominant forest cover in tropical regions. Uncertainties in predicting responses of these ecosystems to climate change arise from high tree species diversity, complex links between eco-physiology and demography, and the role of ontogeny and competition in mediating individual tree responses to climate. The dynamic nature of second-growth forests adds further uncertainty to our ability to quantify the relative importance of climate in mediating successional trajectories.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* To address these uncertainties, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian neighbourhood modelling approach that quantifies how the joint response of two key functional axes, wood density and specific leaf area (SLA), modulate impacts of inter-annual variation in seasonal water stress (number of days during dry season {\textgreater} 1 kPa vapour pressure deficit) and night-time temperature on growth and survival of small (5–10 cm dbh) and large (≥ 10 cm dbh) trees for 171 rainforest species in 6 s-growth and 2 old-growth 1-ha mapped stands. We use model results to examine potential climate impacts on the successional trajectories of these stands.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* High water stress reduced large tree growth but favoured growth of small trees. Drought also reduced tree survival for both large and small trees. Tree species with high wood density suffered lower growth reductions and had higher survival under water stress. High SLA magnified the negative effects of water stress on tree growth and survival. Across all tree sizes, high night-time temperatures did not influence growth or survival. Simulated successional trajectories under different climate scenarios using these results suggest that multi-annual droughts will have substantial impacts of the successional trajectories of tropical forests, leading to lower stem numbers, basal area and biomass. Sustained drought will also shift functional composition of second-growth forest by favouring species with low SLA which tend to dominate in late stages of succession.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* By incorporating trait-mediated effects on key drivers of tree demography and successional dynamics, our approach provides an integrated perspective on interspecific variation in vulnerability to drought and consequences for successional trajectories in tropical rainforests. Our results suggest that multi-annual drought stress will significantly alter structure, composition and dynamics of second-growth forests and, from a functional perspective, accelerate succession. However, this effect may be hampered by dispersal limitation of old-growth species into second-growth forests.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n},

A recent Bayesian algorithm implemented in the software STRUCTURE allows the identification of such groups. However, the ability of this algorithm to detect the true number of clusters (K) in a sample of individuals when patterns of dispersal among populations are not homogeneous has not been tested. The goal of this study is to carry out such tests, using various dispersal scenarios from data generated with an individual-based model. We found that in most cases the estimated 'log probability of data' does not provide a correct estimation of the number of clusters, K. However, using an ad hoc statistic DeltaK based on the rate of change in the log probability of data between successive K values, we found that STRUCTURE accurately detects the uppermost hierarchical level of structure for the scenarios we tested. As might be expected, the results are sensitive to the type of genetic marker used (AFLP vs. microsatellite), the number of loci scored, the number of populations sampled, and the number of individuals typed in each sample.},

abstract = {Evolutionary developmental biology has encouraged a change of research emphasis from the sorting of phenotypic variation by natural selection to the production of that variation through development. Some morphologies are more readily generated than others, and developmental mechanisms can limit or channel evolutionary change. Such biases determine how readily populations are able to respond to selection, and have been postulated to explain stasis in morphological evolution and unexplored morphologies. There has been much discussion about evolutionary constraints but empirical data testing them directly are sparse. The spectacular diversity in butterfly wing patterns is suggestive of how little constrained morphological evolution can be. However, for wing patterns involving serial repeats of the same element, developmental properties suggest that some directions of evolutionary change might be restricted. Here we show that despite the developmental coupling between different eyespots in the butterfly Bicyclus anynana, there is great potential for independent changes. This flexibility is consistent with the diversity of wing patterns across species and argues for a dominant role of natural selection, rather than internal constraints, in shaping existing variation.},

We develop a method that aims to evaluate the interaction between phylogenetic structure, historical biogeographic events and environmental filtering in driving species distributions in a large-scale metacommunity. Using freshwater zooplankton as a case study, we contrast the phylogenetic metacommunity structure of calanoid copepods and an ecologically similar but more vagile group, daphniids, in the northeastern US. We find that legacies of historical biogeographical events have strongly constrained calanoid distributions within this area, but that adaptation to different water chemistry and lake morphology drives the metacommunity structure of daphniids. Our findings show that biogeographic history and metacommunity processes jointly regulate community structure in these lakes and suggest that this also depends on factors that affect the colonization rate of different types of organisms.},

abstract = {1. The Mediterranean region has been invaded by a wide range of introduced plant species which differ greatly in their ecology, morphology and human utilization. In order to identify a suite of traits which characterize invasiveness, recent studies have advocated the use of evolutionary relationships to unravel highly confounded influences. 2. This study attempts to identify an evolutionary component to invasiveness and other complex invasion-related traits in the Mediterranean alien flora using an autocorrelation technique, the ‘phylogenetic association test'. I compared a traditional hierarchical taxonomy with the recent phylogeny of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group. 3. Invasiveness did not have a significant phylogenetic component. Any weak clustering was generally at the genus level. 4. Several associated ‘meta-traits' (high introduction frequency, adaptation to several habitat types and favourability for different modes of introduction), exhibited stronger phylogenetic components. Although each of these conveys some of the attributes of invasiveness, their clustering patterns differed considerably, suggesting that they arise from independent evolutionary pressures. Furthermore, within each meta-trait, different clusters may have been selected for different reasons. 5. Other reasons for the lack of a detectable evolutionary component to invasiveness are discussed. Firstly, the results of our test simulations suggested that incorrect phylogeny could result in a moderate degree of error. Secondly, over evolutionary time, complex or stochastic events such as ecosystem change could radically alter the adaptive advantages of particular traits. 6. Synthesis. Since invasiveness has little phylogenetic component, I argue that it is less likely to be predictable from as yet unidentified traits in any simple way. Although trait syndromes could develop without leaving a phylogenetic pattern, its absence probably indicates that the dominant selective forces are responses to short-term ecological shifts, and a greater mechanistic understanding of these is needed.

abstract = {Plant responses to cold stress are mediated by a transcriptional cascade, in which the transcription factor ICE1 and possibly related proteins activate the expression of C-repeat (CRT)-binding factors (CBFs), leading to the transcription of downstream effector genes. The variant RING finger protein high expression of osmotically responsive gene (HOS)1 was identified genetically as a negative regulator of cold responses. We present evidence here that HOS1 is an E3 ligase required for the ubiquitination of ICE1. HOS1 physically interacts with ICE1 and mediates the ubiquitination of ICE1 both in vitro and in vivo. We found that cold induces the degradation of ICE1 in plants, and this degradation requires HOS1. Consistent with enhanced cold-responsive gene expression in loss-of-function hos1 mutant plants, overexpression of HOS1 represses the expression of CBFs and their downstream genes and confers increased sensitivity to freezing stress. Our results indicate that cold stress responses in Arabidopsis are attenuated by a ubiquitination/proteasome pathway in which HOS1 mediates the degradation of the ICE1 protein.},

One hypothesis about competition{\~{O}}s contribution to community assembly is that more closely related species are less likely to coexist. Though empirical evidence for this hypothesis is mixed, it remains a common assumption in certain phylogenetic approaches for inferring the effects of environmental filtering and competitive exclusion. Here, we relate modern coexistence theory to phylogenetic community assembly approaches to refine expectations for how species relatedness influences the outcome of competition. We argue that two types of species differences determine competitive exclusion with opposing effects on relatedness patterns. Importantly, this means that competition can sometimes eliminate more different and less related taxa, even when the traits underlying the relevant species differences are phylogenetically conserved. Our argument leads to a reinterpretation of the assembly processes inferred from community phylogenetic structure.},

abstract = {Fire is a major force driving the evolution of plants and the structure and function of ecosystems globally. It thus likely operates as an important environmental filter that selects for species that have evolved to tolerate and depend on fire. Across a 40-year experimental fire gradient from frequently burned open savanna to unburned dense woodland in Minnesota, USA, we examined the relationships among community assembly, evolutionary history, and functional trait composition. Close relatives had similar abundance patterns across the fire gradient, providing evidence for phylogenetic conservatism in fire adaptation and highlighting the importance of shared ancestry in predicting species responses to fire. Phylogenetic beta diversity was greatest between the most extreme fire treatments across the gradient, indicating that species in the most contrasting fire regimes were most distantly related. Fire strongly influenced diversity, co-occurrence patterns, and leaf trait means and variances within communities. The most frequently burned communities had the highest species richness, exhibited the most resource-conservative leaf traits, and spanned the greatest number of phylogenetic lineages but harbored more close relatives within those lineages than other communities. In contrast, unburned communities had the lowest species diversity, the most acquisitive leaf traits, and the fewest phylogenetic lineages, but close relatives co- occurred less frequently. The largest difference in abundance between treatments occurred within the Rosales, Asteraceae, Vitaceae, and the Poaceae; woody Rosales were strongly selected for in unburned communities, while composites and grasses of the Poaceae were strongly selected for under frequent burning. A major climatic perturbation of consecutive hot, dry summers in the late 1980s prompted a significant shift in the functional and phylogenetic composition of communities. Greater than expected turnover in species composition occurred following the drought years, and then again during the subsequent five-year rebound period. Just after the drought year, turnover was greatest among recently diverged taxa, whereas during the rebound period turnover was greater among taxa that diverged deep in the phylogeny. The drought years also caused a short-term shift in functional traits, including declines in specific leaf area and leaf nitrogen content and an increase in leaf length. These results indicate that the phylogenetic and functional trait composition of communities are responsive both to fire gradients and to shocks to the system, such as climatic perturbation. Key},

Single and low copy nuclear genes, however, may offer some hope for accurately reconstructing phylogenetic relationships of Betula and inferring the origin of In this study, of the third intron of nuclear nitrate reductase to polyploid species. sequences (Nia) were used estimate relationships of known diploid of Betula. Two distinct types of the Nia gene were observed in species Betula. Sequences of one type were gathered from all sampled species; those of the second type, obtained from only B. nana, were not used in phylogenetic analyses. Cloned sequences of the Nia gene varied little within individuals or species. Maximum and likelihood robust phylogenies with similar parsimony analyses generated relationships. Betula alnoides and B. maximowicziana of subgenus Betulaster formed a well clade, which is characterized supported by the racemose pistillate inflorescence. Shrubby species (B. nana and B. michauxii) of a traditionally recognized group did not form a clade. Instead, B. nana was most closely related to white-barked species (e.g., B. p?ndula, B. platyphylla, and B. populifolia) and together they formed a clade with B. nigra. In contrast, B. michauxii is closely allied with B. lenta. Our results that subgenera Betulaster and Betula are monophyletic, while suggest subgenera Chamaebetula and Neurobetula are polyphyletic.},

abstract = {While migration of individuals has been shown to increase the persistence of small isolated populations through a process known as the "rescue effect," the demographic effects that pollen-mediated gene flow may have in plant populations are not known empirically. This study investigates the role that inbreeding depression plays in newly colonized populations of a common, dioecious, weedy species, Silene alba. Experimental greenhouse studies presented here show that S. alba displays high levels of inbreeding depression (expressed as lowered germination success) in progeny produced with inbreeding coefficients of 0.125 (half-sib mated), 0.250 (full-sib mated), and 0.375 (second-generation sib mated). In addition, it is shown that the degree of inbreeding depression in 12 natural colonies varies with the degree of isolation from other established populations. Significantly, data from experimental populations showed that gene flow into patches comprised of full sibs was higher than those observed into patches comprised of unrelated individuals and may serve to mitigate the effects of inbreeding depression. It is suggested that population connectivity through pollen-mediated gene flow may have substantial effects on the persistence of isolated colonies and on the spatial structure of a metapopulation in general.},

Recent studies seeking biological explanations for this pattern have emphasized the role of niche differentiation, as in hypotheses of adaptive radiation and ecological limits to diversity. Yet many other biological explanations might underlie diversification slowdowns. In this paper, we focus on the geographic context of diversification, environment-driven bursts of speciation, failure of clades to keep pace with a changing environment, and protracted speciation. We argue that, despite being currently underemphasized, these alternatives represent biologically plausible explanations that should be considered along with niche differentiation. Testing the importance of these alternative hypotheses might yield fundamentally different explanations for what influences species richness within clades through time. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The large Neotropical family Bromeliaceae presents an outstanding example of adaptive radiation in plants, containing a wide range of terrestrial and epiphytic life-forms occupying many distinct habitats. Diversification in bromeliads has been linked to several key innovations, including water- and nutrient-impounding phytotelmata, absorptive epidermal trichomes, and the water-conserving mode of photosynthesis known as crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM). To clarify the origins of CAM and the epiphytic habit, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences for 51 bromeliad taxa by using the plastid loci matK and the rps16 intron, combined with a survey of photosynthetic pathway determined by carbon-isotope ratios for 1,873 species representing 65{\%} of the family. Optimization of character-states onto the strict consensus tree indicated that the last common ancestor of Bromeliaceae was a terrestrial C(3) mesophyte, probably adapted to moist, exposed, nutrient-poor habitats. Both CAM photosynthesis and the epiphytic habit evolved a minimum of three times in the family, most likely in response to geological and climatic changes in the late Tertiary. The great majority of epiphytic forms are now found in two lineages: in subfamily Tillandsioideae, in which C(3) photosynthesis was the ancestral state and CAM developed later in the most extreme epiphytes, and in subfamily Bromelioideae, in which CAM photosynthesis predated the appearance of epiphytism. Subsequent radiation of the bromelioid line into less xeric habitats has led to reversion to C(3) photosynthesis in some taxa, showing that both gain and loss of CAM have occurred in the complex evolutionary history of this family.},

E. uniflora plays an important role in the maintenance of {\^{a}}€˜Restinga{\^{a}}€™ ecosystems, at the interface between forest and strand vegetation. Here, we characterize the genetic diversity, its allocation within and between populations and the possible components of nuclear and cytoplasmic gene flow that determine the spatial distribution of the genetic variability. Five E. uniflora populations encompassing distinct biogeographical components were sampled: populations at extremes of latitudinal distribution, at an oceanic island and close to the major urban centre of Rio de Janeiro. AFLP markers showed that genetic variance among studied populations was moderate (Fst = 0.211) with 78.9{\%} of variability residing within populations. The estimated seed and pollen components of gene flow among populations were approximately equal, with a ratio between 1.003 and 0.713 in function of the cpDNA marker used. The five populations present a considerable genetic structure, as assigned by both nuclear and chloroplastic DNA markers. Our data suggest the existence of different glacial refugia and a limited pollen and seed gene flow, mainly between the southern and the other regions enclosed in the Atlantic rain forest. Therefore, any strategy of conservation and management has to assure the preservation of several populations along the Atlantic coast, to maintain the majority of the intra specific level of diversity},

abstract = {The evolutionary dissimilarity between communities (phylogenetic beta diversity PBD) has been increasingly explored by ecologists and biogeographers to assess the relative roles of ecological and evolutionary processes in structuring natural communities. Among PBD measures, the PhyloSor and UniFrac indices have been widely used to assess the level of turnover of lineages over geographical and environmental gradients. However, these indices can be considered as 'broad-sense' measures of phylogenetic turnover as they incorporate different aspects of differences in evolutionary history between communities that may be attributable to phylogenetic diversity gradients. In the present study, we extend an additive partitioning framework proposed for compositional beta diversity to PBD. Specifically, we decomposed the PhyloSor and UniFrac indices into two separate components accounting for 'true' phylogenetic turnover and phylogenetic diversity gradients, respectively. We illustrated the relevance of this framework using simple theoretical and archetypal examples, as well as an empirical study based on coral reef fish communities. Overall, our results suggest that using PhyloSor and UniFrac may greatly over-estimate the level of spatial turnover of lineages if the two compared communities show contrasting levels of phylogenetic diversity. We therefore recommend that future studies use the 'true' phylogenetic turnover component of these indices when the studied communities encompass a large phylogenetic diversity gradient.},

abstract = {Pollination systems frequently reflect adaptations to particular groups of pollinators. Such systems are indicative of evolutionary specialization and have been important in angiosperm diversification. We studied the evolution of pollination systems in the large genus Ruellia. Phylogenetic analyses, morphological ordinations, ancestral state reconstructions, and a character mapping simulation were conducted to reveal key patterns in the direction and lability of floral characters associated with pollination. We found significant floral morphological differences among species that were generally associated with different groups of floral visitors. Floral evolution has been highly labile and also directional. Some specialized systems such as hawkmoth or bat pollination are likely evolutionary dead-ends. In contrast, specialized pollination by hummingbirds is clearly not a dead-end. We found evidence for multiple reverse transitions from presumed ancestral hummingbird pollination to more derived bee or insect pollination. These repeated origins of insect pollination from hummingbird-pollinated ancestors have not evolved without historical baggage. Flowers of insect-pollinated species derived from hummingbird-pollinated ancestors are morphologically more similar to hummingbird flowers than they are to other more distantly related insect-pollinated flowers. Finally, some pollinator switches were concomitant with changes in floral morphology that are associated with those pollinators. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that some transitions have been adaptive in the evolution of Ruellia.},

abstract = {One of the most important floristic sorting periods to affect modern plant communities occurred during the shift from the wet Tertiary period to the unusually dry Quaternary, when most global deserts developed. During this time, a wave of new plant species emerged, presumably in response to the new climate. Interestingly, most Tertiary species that have been tracked through the fossil record did not disappear but remained relatively abundant despite the development of a much more unfavorable climate for species adapted to moist conditions. Here we find, by integrating paleobotanical, ecological, and phylogenetic analyses, that a large number of ancient Tertiary species in Mediterranean-climate ecosystems appear to have been preserved by the facilitative or "nurse" effects of modern Quaternary species. Our results indicate that these interdependent relationships among plants have played a central role in the preservation of the global biodiversity and provided a mechanism for stabilizing selection and the conservation of ecological traits over evolutionary time scales.},

LIBERTY provides a simulation, at a fine spectral resolution, of quasiinfinite leaf reflectance (as represented by stacked leaves) and single leaf reflectance. Single leaf reflectance and transmittance are important input variables to vegetation canopy reflectance models. A prototype parameterization of LIBERTY was based upon measurements of pine needles mid known absorption coefficients of pure component leaf biochemicals. The estimated infinite-reflectance output was compared with the spectra of both dried and fresh pine needles with root mean square errors (RMSE) of 2.87{\%} and 1.73{\%}, respectively. The comparisons between measured and estimated reflectance and transmittance values for single needles were also very accurate with RSME of 1.84{\%} and 1.12{\%}, respectively. Initial inversion studies have demonstrated that significant improvements can be made to LIBERTY by utilizing in vivo absorption coefficients which have been determined by the inversion process.

abstract = {The primary rationale for the use of phylogenetically based statistical methods is that phylogenetic signal, the tendency for related species to resemble each other, is ubiquitous. Whether this assertion is true for a given trait in a given lineage is an empirical question, but general tools for detecting and quantifying phylogenetic signal are inadequately developed. We present new methods for continuous-valued characters that can be implemented with either phylogenetically independent contrasts or generalized least-squares models. First, a simple randomization procedure allows one to test the null hypothesis of no pattern of similarity among relatives. The test demonstrates correct Type I error rate at a nominal alpha = 0.05 and good power (0.8) for simulated datasets with 20 or more species. Second, we derive a descriptive statistic, K, which allows valid comparisons of the amount of phylogenetic signal across traits and trees. Third, we provide two biologically motivated branch-length transformations, one based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model of stabilizing selection, the other based on a new model in which character evolution can accelerate or decelerate (ACDC) in rate (e.g., as may occur during or after an adaptive radiation). Maximum likelihood estimation of the OU (d) and ACDC (g) parameters can serve as tests for phylogenetic signal because an estimate of d or g near zero implies that a phylogeny with little hierarchical structure (a star) offers a good fit to the data. Transformations that improve the fit of a tree to comparative data will increase power to detect phylogenetic signal and may also be preferable for further comparative analyses, such as of correlated character evolution. Application of the methods to data from the literature revealed that, for trees with 20 or more species, 92{\%} of traits exhibited significant phylogenetic signal (randomization test), including behavioral and ecological ones that are thought to be relatively evolutionarily malleable (e.g., highly adaptive) and/or subject to relatively strong environmental (nongenetic) effects or high levels of measurement error. Irrespective of sample size, most traits (but not body size, on average) showed less signal than expected given the topology, branch lengths, and a Brownian motion model of evolution (i.e., K was less than one), which may be attributed to adaptation and/or measurement error in the broad sense (including errors in estimates of phenotypes, branch lengths, and topology). Analysis of variance of log K for all 121 traits (from 35 trees) indicated that behavioral traits exhibit lower signal than body size, morphological, life-history, or physiological traits. In addition, physiological traits (corrected for body size) showed less signal than did body size itself. For trees with 20 or more species, the estimated OU (25{\%} of traits) and/or ACDC (40{\%}) transformation parameter differed significantly from both zero and unity, indicating that a hierarchical tree with less (or occasionally more) structure than the original better fit the data and so could be preferred for comparative analyses.},

We summarize these findings by formulating six generalizations stating that LDD is generally more common in open terrestrial landscapes, and is typically driven by large and migratory animals, extreme meteorological phenomena, ocean currents and human transportation, each transporting a variety of seed morphologies. LDD is often associated with unusual behavior of the standard vector inferred from plant dispersal morphology, or mediated by nonstandard vectors. To advance our understanding of LDD, we advocate a vector-based research approach that identifies the significant LDD vectors and quantifies how environmental conditions modify their actions. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Two emerging fields, metacommunity ecology and community phylogenetics, have been making relevant, though rather independent, progress toward understanding how communities are assembled in space. Our main goals were twofold. First, we described a heuristical framework to merge these two fields into ‘‘metacommunity phylogenetics.'' The main goal of this framework is to provide a way to think about how niche properties of species arranged across the environment and different spatial scales influence the process of community assembly. Second, we developed an analytical frameworktolinkniche properties basedontrait andphylogenetics to environmental and spatial variation.

Two types of nodules, with indeter-minate or determinate growth, evolved from each of these. Knowledge of the diversity of bacteria known to nodulate legumes and their relations with other bac-teria is expanding rapidly, posing new questions about nodulation in the field. Ectomycorrhizas (ECMs) are found in both nodulating and non-nodulating le-gumes and may be important in some environments. This Update will address the following topics: (1) when and where nodulation evolved in legumes; (2) the key processes that led to nodule structures found in extant legumes; (3) the growing number of nitrogen-fixing bacteria known to nodulate legumes; and (4) the role of ECMs and endomycorrhizas in certain legume groups. WHEN DID NODULATION EVOLVE? Among the three subfamilies of legumes, nodulation has long been known to be rare in Caesalpinioideae, common in Mimosoideae, and very common in Papil-ionoideae, a sequence thought to be consistent with the order in which these subfamilies evolved (Allen and Allen, 1981). However, using a range of molecular data rooted using well-characterized legume fossils, Lavin et al. (2005) developed a chronology for legume evolu-tion in which they dated the origin of legumes at about 59 million years before present, with all three subfam-ilies recognizable soon after. Particularly significant for nodule evolution is that two major papilionoid groups, the dalbergioid and genistoid legumes, appeared early, about 55 million years ago. The dalbergioid legumes are a monophyletic clade, one of whose distinguishing characteristics is the possession of aeschynomenoid nodules (Lavin et al., 2001; Fig. 1B). Aeschynomenoid nodules have no uninfected cells in the infected region and their infection processes do not involve trans-cellular ITs. Although there is less information about the genistoid legumes, many also appear to have these characteristics, but with nodules having indeterminate rather than determinate growth (Fig. 1D). Other nodu-lated legumes, all of whose origins also date back to 55 to 50 million years ago, appear to have transcellular ITs in their developing nodules, although these are not necessarily involved in the infection process. Thus, two lines of nodule development appear to have been established at about the same time. Doyle and Luckow (2003) suggested that there may have been four separate events leading to nodulation in legumes, but also pointed out that resolution of the basal, non-nodulating clades of legumes is still incom-plete and may change in the coming years. So far there is no additional information to resolve this question, so in this Update we concentrate on the processes leading to formation of nodules, rather than the number of nodulation events.},

This method uses the approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approach, where the data are summarized into a small number of informative summary statistics. We used three statistics: the number of species in the sample, Shannon H index of evenness and Shao and Sokal's B(1) index of phylogenetic tree imbalance. Our approach was found to outperform previous methods, illustrating the potential of ABC methods in ecology. Applying it to four large tropical forest tree data sets, the best-fit immigration rates m were found to be two orders of magnitude smaller and regional diversities theta larger than previously reported for the same data. This implies that neutral-compatible regional pools of tropical trees should extend over continental scales, and that m measures, in this context, mostly the frequency of long-distance dispersal events.},

abstract = {We studied the evolution of leaf size, sapling canopy allometry, and related traits in 17 Acer species growing in the understory of temperate deciduous forests, using parsimony methods, randomization tests, and independent contrasts calculated on a phylogeny inferred from nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences. Bivariate correlations and multivariate analyses indicated two independent suites of coevolving traits, and the results were robust over a range of alternative phylogenies. The first suite consisted of strong positive correlations among twig thickness, leaf size, inflorescence length, and branch spacing (Corner's rules). Seed size and mature height were also weakly correlated with these traits. The second suite reflected aspects of sapling crown allometry, including crown size, stem diameter, and total leaf area, which appear to be related to shade tolerance. There was a weak negative correlation between sapling crown size and mature height, but no correlation with leaf or seed size. Most correlations were similar in magnitude for ahistorical and independent contrasts analyses, and discrepancies between these two measures were greater in traits with lower levels of convergent evolution. The evolutionary correlations among twig, leaf, seed, inflorescence, and canopy dimensions emphasize the need for integrated theories of evolution and function of these disparate traits.},

abstract = {Plants and their herbivores constitute more than half of the organisms in tropical forests. Therefore, a better understanding of the evolution of plant defenses against their herbivores may be central for our understanding of tropical biodiversity. Here, we address the evolution of antiherbivore defenses and their possible contribution to coexistence in the Neotropical tree genus Inga (Fabaceae). Inga has {\textgreater}300 species, has radiated recently, and is frequently one of the most diverse and abundant genera at a given site. For 37 species from Panama and Peru we characterized developmental, ant, and chemical defenses against herbivores. We found extensive variation in defenses, but little evidence of phylogenetic signal. Furthermore, in a multivariate analysis, developmental, ant, and chemical defenses varied independently (were orthogonal) and appear to have evolved independently of each other. Our results are consistent with strong selection for divergent defensive traits, presumably mediated by herbivores. In an analysis of community assembly, we found that Inga species co-occurring as neighbors are more different in antiherbivore defenses than random, suggesting that possessing a rare defense phenotype increases fitness. These results imply that interactions with herbivores may be an important axis of niche differentiation that permits the coexistence of many species of Inga within a single site. Interactions between plants and their herbivores likely play a key role in the generation and maintenance of the conspicuously high plant diversity in the tropics.},

abstract = {Widely separated plant communities supported by similar physical environments can display much similarity in their life form spectra even though these communities are often floristically unrelated. Such structural similarity reveals the strength of the physical environment in natural selection, particularly for the height, position, and duration of the perennating bud-the underlying premise of Raunkiaer's life form system. But similarities among communities in life form spectra can be limited in part by phylogenetic constraints within the native flora. Phylogenetic constraint has been forcefully and repeatedly demonstrated with the arrival into new ranges of species with novel life forms that have become invasive (i. e., alien species with life forms novel to a recipient community have often become persistent, prolific, and even dominant). Communities invaded by species with a heretofore unrepresented life form are exceptionally diverse, both geographically and environmentally, and include coastal foredunes, intertidal mud flats, riparian sites, temperate grasslands, temperate marshes, and subtropical and temperate forests. The frequency with which alien trees (Acacia nilotica, Myrica pigra, Pinus taeda, Sapium sebiferum) have invaded native grasslands and other treeless communities calls into question the degree to which intrinsic physical limitations compared with phylogenetic constraints have influenced the current extent of these communities worldwide. In effect, invasions by species representing novel life forms in their new ranges have become ongoing, unintentional experiments for detecting phylogenetic constraint in any flora. Identification of native communities at risk of plant invasion may improve through closer examination of their life form spectra for opportunities for the establishment of previously absent life forms.},

abstract = {Brazilian peppertree (Schinus terebinthifolius) is a woody perennial that has invaded much of Florida. This native of northeastern Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil was brought as an ornamental to both the west and east coasts of Florida at the end of the 19th century. It was recorded as an invader of natural areas in the 1950s, and has since extended its range to cover over 280 000 ha. Our goals were to understand the history of this invasion, as one step toward understanding why this exotic was so successful, and ultimately to improve development of biological control agents. We sampled plants from the native and exotic ranges, particularly Florida, and genotyped these individuals at nuclear and chloroplast loci. Nuclear microsatellite and cpDNA loci reveal strong genetic population structure consistent with limited dispersal in the introduced and native ranges. Bayesian clustering of microsatellite data separates the east and west coast plants in Florida into distinct populations. The two chloroplast haplotypes found in Florida are also concordant with this separation: one predominates on the east coast, the other on the west coast. Analysis of samples collected in South America shows that haplotypes as distinct as the two in Florida are unlikely to have come from a single source population. We conclude that the genetic evidence supports two introductions of Brazilian peppertree into Florida and extensive hybridization between them. The west coast genotype likely came from coastal Brazil at about 27 degrees south, whereas the east coast genotype probably originated from another, as yet unidentified site. As a result of hybridization, the Florida population does not exhibit low genetic variation compared to populations in the native range, possibly increasing its ability to adapt to novel environments. Hybridization also has important consequences for the selection of biocontrol agents since it will not be possible to identify closely co-adapted natural enemies in the native range, necessitating more extensive host testing.},

abstract = {Background South America is one of the most species diverse continents in the world. Within South America diversity is not distributed evenly at both local and continental scales and this has led to the recognition of various areas with unique species assemblages. Several schemes currently exist which divide the continental-level diversity into large species assemblages referred to as biomes. Here we review five currently available biome maps for South America, including the WWF Ecoregions, the Americas basemap, the Land Cover Map of South America, Morrone's Biogeographic regions of Latin America, and the Ecological Systems Map. The comparison is performed through a case study on the Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest (SDTF) biome using herbarium data of habitat specialist species. Results Current biome maps of South America perform poorly in depicting SDTF distribution. The poor performance of the maps can be attributed to two main factors: (1) poor spatial resolution, and (2) poor biome delimitation. Poor spatial resolution strongly limits the use of some of the maps in GIS applications, especially for areas with heterogeneous landscape such as the Andes. Whilst the Land Cover Map did not suffer from poor spatial resolution, it showed poor delimitation of biomes. The results highlight that delimiting structurally heterogeneous vegetation is difficult based on remote sensed data alone. A new refined working map of South American SDTF biome is proposed, derived using the Biome Distribution Modelling (BDM) approach where georeferenced herbarium data is used in conjunction with bioclimatic data. Conclusions Georeferenced specimen data play potentially an important role in biome mapping. Our study shows that herbarium data could be used as a way of ground-truthing biome maps in silico. The results also illustrate that herbarium data can be used to model vegetation maps through predictive modelling. The BDM approach is a promising new method in biome mapping, and could be particularly useful for mapping poorly known, fragmented, or degraded vegetation. We wish to highlight that biome delimitation is not an exact science, and that transparency is needed on how biomes are used as study units in macroevolutionary and ecological research.},

abstract = {The genus Rosa (roses) comprises approximately 190 shrub species distributed widely throughout the temperate and subtropical habitats of the northern hemisphere. Despite numerous recent studies examining phylogenetic relationships in the genus, relationships remain obscure due to problems such as poor identification of garden specimens, hybridization in nature and in the garden, and low levels of chloroplast and nuclear genome variation. Phylogenetic analyses of non-coding chloroplast sequences from the trnL-F region and psbA-trnH intergenic spacer for 70 taxa show slightly more variation than previous analyses of the genus. Bayesian and parsimony analyses suggest that subg. Rosa can be divided into two large clades, each with low internal resolution. One comprises species from sections Carolinae, Cinnamomeae and Pimpinellifoliae p.p., whilst the other consists of all of the remaining sections of subg. Rosa (Banksianae p.p., Bracteatae, Caninae, Indicae, Laevigatae, Rosa, Synstylae and Pimpinellifoliae p.p.). A fairly complete sampling of field-collected North American taxa has been incorporated in this analysis. Analyses indicate that migration into North America occurred at least twice within this primarily Old World genus. Most North American taxa, except R. setigera and R. minutifolia, fall into a single clade that includes Asian and European taxa. Analyses also are consistent with the notion that cultivated commercial roses have a relatively narrow genetic background. Six of the seven primary taxa believed to be involved in the creation of domesticated roses are found within the same large clade that mostly includes Asian and European taxa.},

abstract = {Phylogenetic trees of present-day species allow investigation of the rate of evolution that led to the present-day diversity. A recent analysis of the mammalian phylogeny challenged the view of explosive mammalian evolution after the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K/T) boundary (65 Mya). However, due to lack of appropriate methods, the diversification (speciation minus extinction) rates in the more recent past of mammalian evolution could not be determined. In this paper, I provide a method that reveals that the tempo of mammalian evolution did not change until ∼ 33 Mya. This constant period was followed by a peak of diversification rates between 33 and 30 Mya. Thereafter, diversification rates remained high and constant until 8.55 Mya. Diversification rates declined significantly at 8.55 and 3.35 Mya. Investigation of mammalian subgroups (marsupials, placentals, and the six largest placental subgroups) reveals that the diversification rate peak at 33-30 Mya is mainly driven by rodents, cetartiodactyla, and marsupials. The recent diversification rate decrease is significant for all analyzed subgroups but eulipotyphla, cetartiodactyla, and primates. My likelihood approach is not limited to mammalian evolution. It provides a robust framework to infer diversification rate changes and mass extinction events in phylogenies, reconstructed from, e.g., present-day species or virus data. In particular, the method is very robust toward noise and uncertainty in the phylogeny and can account for incomplete taxon sampling.},

abstract = {Pleurocarpous mosses, characterized by lateral female gametangia and highly branched, interwoven stems, comprise three orders and some 5000 species, or almost half of all moss diversity. Recent phylogenetic analyses resolve the Ptychomniales as sister to the Hypnales plus Hookeriales. Species richness is highly asymmetric with approximately 100 Ptychomniales, 750 Hookeriales, and 4400 Hypnales. Chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) sequences were obtained to compare partitioning of molecular diversity among the orders with estimates of species richness, and to test the hypothesis that either the Hookeriales or Hypnales underwent a period (or periods) of exceptionally rapid diversification. Levels of biodiversity were quantified using explicitly historical "phylogenetic diversity" and non-historical estimates of standing sequence diversity. Diversification rates were visualized using lineage-through-time (LTT) plots, and statistical tests of alternative diversification models were performed using the methods of Paradis (1997). The effects of incomplete sampling on the shape of LTT plots and performance of statistical tests were investigated using simulated phylogenies with incomplete sampling. Despite a much larger number of accepted species, the Hypnales contain lower levels of (cpDNA) biodiversity than their sister group, the Hookeriales, based on all molecular measures. Simulations confirm previous results that incomplete sampling yields diversification patterns that appear to reflect a decreasing rate through time, even when the true phylogenies were simulated with constant rates. Comparisons between simulated results and empirical data indicate that a constant rate of diversification cannot be rejected for the Hookeriales. The Hypnales, however, appear to have undergone a period of exceptionally rapid diversification for the earliest 20{\%} of their history.},

abstract = {It is well known that species evolutionary history plays a crucial role in community assembly. Here, we offer a formal analytical framework to integrate in metacommunity analysis the species? phylogeny with their functional traits and abundances. We define phylogenetic structure of a community as phylogenetically weighted species composition. This is used to reveal patterns of phylogenetic community variation and to measure and test by specified null models the phylogenetic signal at the metacommunity level, which we distinguish from phylogenetic signal at the species pool level. The former indicates that communities more similar in their phylogenetic structure are also similar in their average trait values, which may indicate species? niche conservation for the given traits. We apply this framework to an example from grassland communities and find that traits with significant phylogenetic signal at the metacommunity level exhibit ecological filtering along the resource gradient, but since both mechanisms act independently on traits, niche conservatism is not supported.},

This study deals with only one of the main savanna woodland physiognomies, cerrado sensu stricto. Floristic and structural patterns of the woody flora of cerrado s.s. are studied over an area of 10 ° latitude and 8 ° longitude. Data from 220 (20 × 50 m) plots containing 22,306 stems of woody plants ≥ 5 cm diameter at 30 cm above ground level were compared to determine phytogeo- graphical patterns. Two main phytogeographical units were detected, the highlands in the central area, and the lowlands in the north-north-eastern borders of the biome. Beta-diversity was high especially due to the variation in density of species between sites. The floristic and structural variations fitted well with the pattern of land system zoning of the cerrado biome based on variation in climate, landscape and soil types. Sites grouped in the same physiographical unit as defined by Cochrane et al. (1985) showed a higher similarity in the presence of preferential species related to altitude, latitude and soil types.},

abstract = {Biomes are areas of vegetation that are characterized by the same life-form. Traditional definitions of biomes have also included either geographical or climatic descriptors. This approach describes a wide range of biomes that can be correlated with characteristic climatic conditions, or climatic envelopes. The application of remote sensing technology to the frequent observation of biomes has led to a move away from the often subjective definition of biomes to one that is objective. Carefully characterized observations of life-form, by satellite, have been used to reconsider biome classification and their climatic envelopes. Five major tree biomes can be recognized by satellites based on leaf longevity and morphology: needleleaf evergreen, broadleaf evergreen, needleleaf deciduous, broadleaf cold deciduous and broadleaf drought deciduous. Observations indicate that broadleaf drought deciduous vegetation grades substantially into broadleaf evergreen vegetation. The needleleaf deciduous biome occurs in the world's coldest climates, where summer drought and therefore a drought deciduous biome are absent. Traditional biome definitions are quite static, implying no change in their life-form composition with time, within their particular climatic envelopes. However, this is not the case where there has been global ingress of grasslands and croplands into forested vegetation. The global spread of grasses, a new super-biome, was probably initiated 30-45 Myr ago by an increase in global aridity, and was driven by the natural spread of the disturbances of fire and animal grazing. These disturbances have been further extended over the Holocene era by human activities that have increased the land areas available for domestic animal grazing and for growing crops. The current situation is that grasses now occur in most, if not all biomes, and in many areas they dominate and define the biome. Croplands are also increasing, defining a new and relatively recent component to the grassland super-biome. In the case of both grassland and croplands, various forms of disturbance, particularly frequent disturbance, lead to continued range extensions of the biomes.},

abstract = {Ecological interactions are crucial to understanding both the ecology and the evolution of organisms. Because the phenotypic traits regulating species interactions are largely a legacy of their ancestors, it is widely assumed that ecological interactions are phylogenetically conserved, with closely related species interacting with similar partners. However, the existing empirical evidence is inadequate to appropriately evaluate the hypothesis of phylogenetic conservatism in ecological interactions, because it is both ecologically and taxonomically biased. In fact, most studies on the evolution of ecological interactions have focused on specialized organisms, such as some parasites or insect herbivores, belonging to a limited subset of the overall tree of life. Here we study the evolution of host use in a large and diverse group of interactions comprising both specialist and generalist acellular, unicellular and multicellular organisms. We show that, as previously found for specialized interactions, generalized interactions can be evolutionarily conserved. Significant phylogenetic conservatism of interaction patterns was equally likely to occur in symbiotic and non-symbiotic interactions, as well as in mutualistic and antagonistic interactions. Host-use differentiation among species was higher in phylogenetically conserved clades, irrespective of their generalization degree and taxonomic position within the tree of life. Our findings strongly suggest a shared pattern in the organization of biological systems through evolutionary time, mediated by marked conservatism of ecological interactions among taxa.},

abstract = {The constant rate birth-death process is used as a stochastic model for many biological systems, for example phylogenies or disease transmission. As the biological data are usually not fully available, it is crucial to understand the effect of incomplete sampling. In this paper, we analyze the constant rate birth-death process with incomplete sampling. We derive the density of the bifurcation events for trees on n leaves which evolved under this birth-death-sampling process. This density is used for calculating prior distributions in Bayesian inference programs and for efficiently simulating trees. We show that the birth-death-sampling process can be interpreted as a birth-death process with reduced rates and complete sampling. This shows that joint inference of birth rate, death rate and sampling probability is not possible. The birth-death-sampling process is compared to the sampling-based population genetics model, the coalescent. It is shown that despite many similarities between these two models, the distribution of bifurcation times remains different even in the case of very large population sizes. We illustrate these findings on an Hepatitis C virus dataset from Egypt. We show that the transmission times estimates are significantly different-the widely used Gamma statistic even changes its sign from negative to positive when switching from the coalescent to the birth-death process. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The organisms that live together in a community do so both because they are present in the larger regional pool and because they have characteristics that permit their existence at that locality and their coexistence with other species in the community. Neither a species' regional presence nor its characters can be fully understood without taking the species' history into account. That history is contingent on chance events and on deterministic interactions with other species in historical communities. As this historical approach gains favor in ecology, and as our understanding of the tree of life expands, ecologists and systematists are increasingly working together. However, this new partnership often requires synthesizing ideas across disciplines. Our goal with this Special Issue is to explore the practical interchange of concepts between evolutionary biology and community ecology, highlighting studies that both use phylogenetic information and consider the community context of individual organisms, and that represent a range of disciplines, from microbiology and parasitology to ornithology. Several common threads weave through the papers. The first concerns the importance and definition of the local community itself. As one steps back and takes a historical and biogeographic view of a species, averaging over variation in local community composition across its range, local interspecific interactions appear less influential for the species' evolution. Ricklefs, in considering the causes of variation in the emergent property of community species richness, goes so far as to say that ‘‘ecologists [must] abandon the idea of the local community.'' At the same time, however, there is abundant evidence that inter-individual interactions do influence which particular taxa co-occur (e.g., Webb et al.), alter their ranges, and under certain circumstances, lead to evolutionary adap- tation that reduces negative interspecific interaction. Separating the effects of local processes on regional patterns and regional processes on local patterns will always be hard. However, with large and numerous samples we can come to understand variation in community structure over wide areas. Lovette and Hochachka draw on the vast Breeding Bird Survey data set to examine both local and regional composition in warbler communities, and Kembel and Hubbell examine phylogenetic community structure of trees at varying scales within the 50-ha BCI Forest Dynamics Plot},

As we discuss here, preliminary evidence supports the hypothesis that there is a dynamic interplay between ecology and evolution within communities, yet researchers have not yet demonstrated convincingly whether, and under what circumstances, it is important for biologists to bridge community ecology and evolutionary biology.

abstract = {There is a growing interest in identifying ecological factors that influence adaptive genetic diversity patterns in both model and nonmodel species. The emergence of large genomic and environmental data sets, as well as the increasing sophistication of population genetics methods, provides an opportunity to characterize these patterns in relation to the environment. Landscape genetics has emerged as a flexible analytical framework that connects patterns of adaptive genetic variation to environmental heterogeneity in a spatially explicit context. Recent growth in this field has led to the development of numerous spatial statistical methods, prompting a discussion of the current benefits and limitations of these approaches. Here we provide a review of the design of landscape genetics studies, the different statistical tools, some important case studies, and perspectives on how future advances in this field are likely to shed light on important processes in evolution and ecology.},

abstract = {Community ecology is often perceived as a "mess, "given the seemingly vast number of processes that can underlie the many patterns of interest, and the apparent uniqueness of each study system. However, at the most general level, patterns in the composition and diversity of species--the subject matter of community ecology--are influenced by only four classes of process: selection, drift, speciation, and dispersal. Selection represents deterministic fitness differences among species, drift represents stochastic changes in species abundance, speciation creates new species, and dispersal is the movement of organisms across space. All theoretical and conceptual models in community ecology can be understood with respect to their emphasis on these four processes. Empirical evidence exists for all of these processes and many of their interactions, with a predominance of studies on selection. Organizing the material of community ecology according to this framework can clarify the essential similarities and differences among the many conceptual and theoretical approaches to the discipline, and it can also allow for the articulation of a very general theory of community dynamics: species are added to communities via speciation and dispersal, and the relative abundances of these species are then shaped by drift and selection, as well as ongoing dispersal to drive community dynamics.},

An independent record with better geographic coverage would be valuable in understanding recent change in the context of natural variability. We compiled the Paleo Index (PI) from 173 temperature-sensitive proxy time series (corals, ice cores, speleothems, lake and ocean sediments, historical documents). Each series was normalized to produce index values of change relative to a 1901G{\c{C}}{\^{o}}2000 base period; the index values were then averaged. From 1880 to 1995, the index trends significantly upward, similar to the GST. Smaller-scale aspects of the GST including two warming trends and a warm interval during the 1940s are also observed in the PI. The PI extends to 1730 with 67 records. The upward trend appears to begin in the early 19th century but the year-to-year variability is large and the 1730G{\c{C}}{\^{o}}1929 trend is small},

Recent improvements in plant growth modelling have allowed deeper understanding and more accurate predictions for a wide range of ecological issues, including competition among plants, plant–herbivore interactions and ecosystem function- ing. 2. One challenge in modelling plant growth is that, for a variety of reasons, relative growth rate (RGR) almost universally decreases with increasing size, although traditional calculations assume thatRGR is constant. Nonlinear growth models are flexible enough to account for varying growth rates. 3. We demonstrate a variety of nonlinear models that are appropriate for modelling plant growth and, for each, show how to calculate function-derived growth rates,which allowunbiased compari- sons among species at a common time or size. We show how to propagate uncertainty in estimated parameters to express uncertainty in growth rates. Fitting nonlinear models can be challenging, so we present extensiveworked examples and practical recommendations, all implemented in R. 4. The use of nonlinearmodels coupled with function-derived growth rates can facilitate the testing of novel hypotheses in population and community ecology.For example, the use of such techniques has allowed better understanding of the components of RGR, the costs of rapid growth and the linkage between host and parasite growth rates.Wehope this contribution will demystify nonlinear modelling and persuademore ecologists to use these techniques.},

abstract = {It is widely acknowledged that integrating fossils into data sets of extant taxa is imperative for proper placement of fossils, resolution of relationships, and a better understanding of character evolution. The importance of this process has been further magnified because of the crucial role of fossils in dating divergence times. Outstanding issues remain, including appropriate methods to place fossils in phylogenetic trees, the importance of molecules versus morphology in these analyses, as well as the impact of potentially large amounts of missing data for fossil taxa. In this study we used the angiosperm clade Juglandaceae as a model for investigating methods of integrating fossils into a phylogenetic framework of extant taxa. The clade has a rich fossil record relative to low extant diversity, as well as a robust molecular phylogeny and morphological database for extant taxa. After combining fossil organ genera into composite and terminal taxa, our objectives were to (1) compare multiple methods for the integration of the fossils and extant taxa (including total evidence, molecular scaffolds, and molecular matrix representation with parsimony [MRP]); (2) explore the impact of missing data (incomplete taxa and characters) and the evidence for placing fossils on the topology; (3) simulate the phylogenetic effect of missing data by creating "artificial fossils"; and (4) place fossils and compare the impact of single and multiple fossil constraints in estimating the age of clades. Despite large and variable amounts of missing data, each of the methods provided reasonable placement of both fossils and simulated "artificial fossils" in the phylogeny previously inferred only from extant taxa. Our results clearly show that the amount of missing data in any given taxon is not by itself an operational guideline for excluding fossils from analysis. Three fossil taxa (Cruciptera simsonii, Paleoplatycarya wingii, and Platycarya americana) were placed within crown clades containing living taxa for which relationships previously had been suggested based on morphology, whereas Polyptera manningii, a mosaic taxon with equivocal affinities, was placed firmly as sister to two modern crown clades. The position of Paleooreomunnea stoneana was ambiguous with total evidence but conclusive with DNA scaffolds and MRP. There was less disturbance of relationships among extant taxa using a total evidence approach, and the DNA scaffold approach did not provide improved resolution or internal support for clades compared to total evidence, whereas weighted MRP retained comparable levels of support but lost crown clade resolution. Multiple internal minimum age constraints generally provided reasonable age estimates, but the use of single constraints provided by extinct genera tended to underestimate clade ages.},

abstract = {This paper reviews how and when African rainforest diversity arose, presenting evidence from both plant and animal studies. Preliminary investigations show that these African forests are an assemblage of species of varying age. Phylogenetic evidence, from both African rainforest angiosperms and vertebrates, suggest a Tertiary origin for the major lineages in some of these groups. In groups where savannah species are well represented and rainforest species are a minority, the latter appear to be relics of a Mid-Tertiary rainforest. By contrast, species that are primarily adapted to rainforest have arisen in the past 10 Myr with the main morphological innovations dating from the Late Miocene, and Quaternary speciation dominating in large, morphologically homogeneous groups. The small number of species-level phylogenies for African rainforest plants hinders a more incisive and detailed study into the historical assembly of these continental forests.},

In this paper, we present and examine a method for estimating community dimension (the number of strongly interacting species or groups) from time series data on a single species. The dynamics of one species can be strongly affected by environmental stochasticity acting not only on itself, but also on other species with which it interacts. By fully accounting for the effects of stochasticity on populations embedded in a community, our approach gives better estimates of community dimension than commonly used methods. Using a combination of time series data and simulations, we show that failing to properly account for stochasticity when attempting to relate population dynamics to attributes of the community can give misleading information about community dimension.},

abstract = {If plants cannot simultaneously acclimate to shade and drought because of physiological trade-offs, then plants are expected to be less tolerant to shading under drier conditions. One observation that, at first sight, seems incompatible with this idea is the fact that the establishment of new plants in dry areas is often restricted to shady sites under the canopy of other plants, called ''nurse plants.'' We use a graphical model to resolve this paradox. The model visualizes how facilitative patterns can be understood from the simultaneous effects of plant canopies on microsite light and moisture, and the growth response of establishing seedlings to those factors. The approach emphasizes the fact that positive and negative effects of plant canopies always occur simultaneously. In the presented light-water model, facilitation only occurs when the improvement of plant water relations under the canopy exceeds the costs caused by lower light levels. This may be true under dry conditions, whereas in less dry situations, competition rather than facilitation is observed. The model shows how changes in water availability may shift interactions from competitive to facilitative and vice versa, as observed in some field patterns. It is argued that other environmental factors explaining facilitative patterns can be understood in the same context.},

abstract = {Sequences of the chloroplast trnC-trnD region and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of nuclear ribosomal DNA were obtained for all species of Panax L. (the ginseng plant genus, Araliaceae) to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships. The trnC-trnD phylogeny is congruent with the ITS phylogeny for the diploid taxa of Panax. This study is the first use of the trnC-trnD sequence data for phylogenetic analysis at the interspecific level. We evaluated this DNA region for its phylogenetic utility at the lower taxonomic level for flowering plants. The trnC-trnD region includes the trnC-petN intergenic spacer, the petN gene, the petN-psbM intergenic spacer, the psbM gene, and the psbM-trnD intergenic spacer. The petN and psbM genes are small, 90 and 104-114 bp across angiosperms, respectively, and have conserved sequences. We have designed universal amplification and sequencing primers within these two genes. Using these primers, we have successfully amplified the entire trnC-trnD region for a diversity of flowering plant groups, including Aralia L. (Araliaceae), Calycanthus L. (Calycanthaceae), Corylus L. (Berulaceae), Hamamelis L. (Hamamelidaceae), Hydrocotyle L. (Apiaceae), Illigera Blume (Hernandiaceae), Nelumbo Adans. (Nelumbonaceae), Nolana L. ex L.f. (Solanaceae), Prunus L. (Rosaceae), and Staphylea L. (Staphyleaceae). In Panax, the trnC-trnD region provides a similar number of informative phylogenetic characters as the ITS regions and a slightly higher number of informative characters than the chloroplast ndhF gene. We thus demonstrate the utility of the trnC-trnD region for lower-level phylogenetic studies in flowering plants. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The morphotypes were two shrubs, Clusia hilariana Schltdl. and Andira legalis (Vell.) Toledo, and the taproot hemicryptophyte Allagoptera arenaria (Gomes) O. Ktze. The physiotype differences were that C. hilariana was performing crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM), A. legalis was a nodulated N2 fixing legume and A. arenaria had ample access to water by ground water tapping roots. All three species were light stressed and showed photoinhibition$\backslash$nand high maximum values of non-photochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence. $\delta$13C values of bulk leaf organic matter (which integrate over the life span of the leaf) and instantaneous gas exchange patterns$\backslash$ndemonstrated that C. hilariana was performing CAM and the other two species C3-photosynthesis. A. arenaria performed generous and A. legalis conserving use of water. Based on the CO2 concentrating mechanism of CAM C. hilariana had the highest maximum rates of apparent photosynthetic electron transport, ETRmax. Uptake of atmospheric CO2 in the afternoon (phase IV of CAM) was expressed weakly showing that the plants were under some but not severe water stress.$\backslash$nA. legalis showed the highest levels of total N and soluble non-protein N-compounds in its organs due to N2 fixation which, however, did not confer a higher photosynthetic capacity that must have been limited by factors other than$\backslash$nnitrogen supply. Accumulation of amino compounds like proline and $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid in leaves of A. legalis which are known to act as osmoprotectants is likely to indicate drought stress in the dry season. Maximum net CO2 uptake of photosynthesis was higher in the water spending A. arenaria than in A. legalis. The comparative analysis of physiological traits characterised either instantaneously or integrated over the longer term$\backslash$nshows that in addition to morphotypic characteristics physiotypic characteristics are important for space occupation and niche$\backslash$nacquisition of the plants in the restinga.},

abstract = {We present a theoretical framework to describe stochastic, size-structured community assembly, and use this framework to make community-level ecological predictions. Our model can be thought of as adding biological realism to Neutral Biodiversity Theory by incorporating size variation and growth dynamics, and allowing demographic rates to depend on the sizes of individuals. We find that the species abundance distribution (SAD) is insensitive to the details of the size structure in our model, demonstrating that the SAD is a poor indicator of size-dependent processes. We also derive the species biomass distribution (SBD) and find that the form of the SBD depends on the underlying size structure. This leads to a prescription for testing multiple, intertwined ecological predictions of the model, and provides evidence that alternatives to the traditional SAD are more closely tied to certain ecological processes. Finally, we describe how our framework may be extended to make predictions for more general types of community structure.},

abstract = {We present a model of a source-sink competitive metacommunity, defined as a regional set of communities in which local diversity is maintained by dispersal. Although the conditions of local and regional coexistence have been well defined in such systems, no study has attempted to provide clear predictions of classical community-wide patterns. Here we provide predictions for species richness, species relative abundances, and community-level functional properties (productivity and space occupation) at the local and regional scales as functions of the proportion of dispersal between communities. Local (alpha) diversity is maximal at an intermediate level of dispersal, whereas between-community (beta) and regional (gamma) diversity decline as dispersal increases because of increased homogenization of the metacommunity. The relationships between local and regional species richness and the species rank abundance distributions are strongly affected by the level of dispersal. Local productivity and space occupation tend to decline as dispersal increases, resulting in either a hump-shaped or a positive relationship between species richness and productivity, depending on the scale considered (local or regional). These effects of dispersal are buffered by decreasing species dispersal success. Our results provide a niche-based alternative to the recent neutral-metacommunity model and have important implications for conservation biology and landscape management.},

abstract = {Evergreen oaks are an emblematic element of the Mediterranean vegetation and have a leaf phenotype that seems to have remained unchanged since the Miocene. We hypothesise that variation of the sclerophyll phenotype among Iberian populations of Quercus coccifera is partly due to an ulterior process of ecotypic differentiation. We analysed the genetic structure of nine Iberian populations using ISSR fingerprints, and their leaf phenotypes using mean and intracanopy plasticity values of eight morphological (leaf angle, area, spinescence, lobation and specific area) and biochemical traits (VAZ pool, chlorophyll and beta-carotene content). Climate and soil were also characterised at the population sites. Significant genetic and phenotypic differences were found among populations and between NE Iberia and the rest of the populations of the peninsula. Mean phenotypes showed a strong and independent correlation with both genetic and geographic distances. Northeastern plants were smaller, less plastic, with smaller, spinier and thicker leaves, a phenotype consistent with the stressful conditions that prevailed in the steppe environments of the refugia within this geographic area during glaciations. These genetic, phenotypic, geographic and environmental patterns are consistent with previously reported palaeoecological and common evidence. Such consistency leads us to conclude that there has been a Quaternary divergence within the sclerophyllous syndrome that was at least partially driven by ecological factors.},

abstract = {Plant adaptation to serpentine soil has been a topic of study for many decades, yet investigation of the genetic component of this adaptation has only recently begun. We review the defining properties of serpentine soil and the pioneering work leading to three established physiological and evolutionary mechanisms hypothesized to be responsible for serpentine tolerance: tolerance of a low calcium-to-magnesium ratio, avoidance of Mg toxicity, or a high Mg requirement. In addition, we review re- cent work in serpentine ecology documenting the high proportion of endemic species present, the adaptive morphologies of serpentine-tolerant plants, and the distinctive structure of serpentine communities. Studies of the physiological mechanisms pro- posed to confer serpentine tolerance have shown that uptake of particular ions and heavy metals varies between serpentine-tolerant and -intolerant species. Recent studies examining the genetic basis of serpentine adaptation have shown serpentine-adaptive quantitative trait loci (QTL) to have large phenotypic effects, drought tolerance to be as important as metal tolerance, and serpentine adaptation to have evolved indepen- dently multiple times within species. Investigations of plant races and species adapted to contrasting soil types have shown disparate flowering times, divergent floral mor- phologies, and pollen incompatibility to contribute to reproductive isolation. Finally, we propose that future studies involving serpentine systems should merge the fields of ecology, evolution, physiology, and genetics.},

Restinga of Jurubatiba National Park, north of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We chose traits that are commonly used in large screenings, leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf longevity (LL) and leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC). We also measured the functional traits, midday leaf water potential (03A8min), pressure-volume curves, nitrogen isotope discrimination (03B415N) and chlorophyll fluorescence. We compared species using ANOVA and ordination analysis. The two most dominant species differed from subordinate species in terms of leaf succulence (SUC) and 03A8min. However, they were also significantly different from each other in LMA, SUC, leaf thickness and LNC. 03A8min and 03B415N had the strongest loadings on the third ordination axis, which, despite explaining only 18.2{\%} of total variance, was the only axis reflecting variation in species dominance. Despite high interspecific variation, the most common traits of the leaf economic spectrum were not directly associated with variation in species dominance. In contrast, the bulk modulus of elasticity, 03A8min and 03B415N were important not only to track the connection between plant traits and environmental factors, but also between plant traits and community structure.},

abstract = {The most rapid species radiations have been reported from 'evolutionary laboratories', such as the Andes and the Cape of South Africa, leading to the prevailing view that diversification elsewhere has not been as dramatic. However, few studies have explicitly assessed rates of diversification in northern regions such as Europe. Here, we show that carnations (Dianthus, Caryophyllaceae), a well-known group of plants from temperate Eurasia, have diversified at the most rapid rate ever reported in plants or terrestrial vertebrates. Using phylogenetic methods, we found that the majority of species of carnations belong to a lineage that is remarkably species-rich in Europe, and arose at the rate of 2.2-7.6 species per million years. Unlike most previous studies that have inferred rates of diversification in young diverse groups, we use a conservative approach throughout that explicitly incorporates the uncertainties associated with phylogenetic inference, molecular dating and incomplete taxon sampling. We detected a shift in diversification rates of carnations coinciding with a period of increase in climatic aridity in the Pleistocene, suggesting a link between climate and biodiversity. This explosive radiation suggests that Europe, the continent with the world's best-studied flora, has been underestimated as a cradle of recent and rapid speciation.},

The repeated discovery of para- phyly has helped disentangle what once appeared to be phylogenetically coincident character changes, but this has also highlighted the existence of sequences of character change, no one ele- ment of which can cleanly be identified as the ‘‘key innovation'' responsible for shifting diversifi- cation rate. In effect, the cause becomes distributed across a nested series of nodes in the tree.Many of the most conspicuous plant ‘‘innovations'' (such as macrophyllous leaves) are underlain by ear- lier,more subtle shifts in development (such as overtopping growth), which appear to have enabled the exploration of a greater range of morphological designs. Often it appears that these underlying changes have been brought about at the level of cell interactions within meristems, highlighting the need for developmental models and experiments focused at this level. The standard practice of attempting to identify correlations between recurrent character change (such as the tree growth habit) and clade diversity is complicated by the observation that the ‘‘same'' trait may be con- structed quite differently in different lineages (e.g., different forms of cambial activity), with some solutions imposing more architectural limitations than others. These thoughts highlight the need for amore nuanced view, which has implications for comparativemethods. They also bear on issues central to Stephen Jay Gould's vision of macroevolution, including exaptation and evolutionary re- currence in relation to constraint and the repeatability of evolution},

In this regard, phylogenetic signal must be distinguished from phylogenetic niche conservatism. Phylogenetic niche conservatism results when closely related species are more ecologically similar that would be expected based on their phylogenetic relationships; its occurrence suggests that some process is constraining divergence among closely related species. In contrast, phylogenetic signal refers to the situation in which ecological similarity between species is related to phylogenetic relatedness; this is the expected outcome of Brownian motion divergence and thus is necessary, but not sufficient, evidence for the existence of phylogenetic niche conservatism. Although many workers consider phylogenetic niche conservatism to be common, a review of case studies indicates that ecological and phylogenetic similarities often are not related. Consequently, ecologists should not assume that phylogenetic niche conservatism exists, but rather should empirically examine the extent to which it occurs.},

abstract = {Seed dispersal is a crucial component of plant population dynamics. Human landscape modifications, such as habitat destruction and fragmentation, can alter the abundance of fruiting plants and animal dispersers, foraging rates, vector movement, and the composition of the disperser community, all of which can singly or in concert affect seed dispersal. Here, we quantify and tease apart the effects of landscape configuration, namely, fragmentation of primary forest and the composition of the surrounding forest matrix, on individual components of seed dispersal of Heliconia acuminata, an Amazonian understory herb. First we identified the effects of landscape configuration on the abundance of fruiting plants and six bird disperser species. Although highly variable in space and time, densities of fruiting plants were similar in continuous forest and fragments. However, the two largest-bodied avian dispersers were less common or absent in small fragments. Second, we determined whether fragmentation affected foraging rates. Fruit removal rates were similar and very high across the landscape, suggesting that Heliconia fruits are a key resource for small frugivores in this landscape. Third, we used radiotelemetry and statistical models to quantify how landscape configuration influences vector movement patterns. Bird dispersers flew farther and faster, and perched longer in primary relative to secondary forests. One species also altered its movement direction in response to habitat boundaries between primary and secondary forests. Finally, we parameterized a simulation model linking data on fruit density and disperser abundance and behavior with empirical estimates of seed retention times to generate seed dispersal patterns in two hypothetical landscapes. Despite clear changes in bird movement in response to landscape configuration, our simulations demonstrate that these differences had negligible effects on dispersal distances. However, small fragments had reduced densities of Turdus albicollis, the largest-bodied disperser and the only one to both regurgitate and defecate seeds. This change in Turdus abundance acted together with lower numbers of fruiting plants in small fragments to decrease the probability of long-distance dispersal events from small patches. These findings emphasize the importance of foraging style for seed dispersal and highlight the primacy of habitat size relative to spatial configuration in preserving biotic interactions.},

We use data from 11 existing vegetation surveys to test whether co-occurrence in schoenoid sedge assemblages in the Cape Floristic Region shows significant phylogenetic structuring and to examine whether this changes with the phylogenetic scale of the analysis. We provide evidence for phylogenetic overdispersion in an alliance of closely related species (the reticulate-sheathed Tetraria clade) using both quantile regression analysis and a comparison between the mean observed and expected phylogenetic distances between co-occurring species. Similar patterns are not evident when the analyses are performed at a broader phylogenetic scale. Examination of six functional traits suggests a general pattern of trait conservatism within the reticulate-sheathed Tetraria clade, suggesting a potential role for interspecific competition in structuring co-occurrence within this group. We suggest that phylogenetic overdispersion of communities may be common throughout many of the Cape lineages, since interspecific interactions are likely intensified in lineages with large numbers of species restricted to a small geographic area, and we discuss the potential implications for patterns of diversity in the Cape.},

abstract = {Evolutionary history can exert a profound influence on ecological communities, but few generalities have emerged concerning the relationships among phylogeny, community membership, and niche evolution. We compared phylogenetic community structure and niche evolution in three lizard clades (Ctenotus skinks, agamids, and diplodactyline geckos) from arid Australia. We surveyed lizard communities at 32 sites in the northwestern Great Victoria Desert and generated complete species-level molecular phylogenies for regional representatives of the three clades. We document a striking pattern of phylogenetic evenness within local communities for all groups: pairwise correlations in species abundance across sites are negatively related to phylogenetic similarity. By modeling site suitability on the basis of species' habitat preferences, we demonstrate that phylogenetic evenness generally persists even after controlling for habitat filtering among species. This phylogenetic evenness is coupled with evolutionary lability of habitat-associated traits, to the extent that closely related species are more divergent in habitat use than distantly related species. In contrast, lizard diets are phylogenetically conserved, and pairwise dietary overlap between species is negatively related to phylogenetic distance in two of the three clades. Our results suggest that contemporary and historical species interactions have led to similar patterns of community structure across multiple clades in one of the world's most diverse lizard communities.},

abstract = {Whatever criteria are used to measure evolutionary success - species numbers, geographic range, ecological abundance, ecological and life history diversity, background diversification rates, or the presence of rapidly evolving clades - the legume family is one of the most successful lineages of flowering plants. Despite this, we still know rather little about the dynamics of lineage and species diversification across the family through the Cenozoic, or about the underlying drivers of diversification. There have been few attempts to estimate net species diversification rates or underlying speciation and extinction rates for legume clades, to test whether among-lineage variation in diversification rates deviates from null expectations, or to locate species diversification rate shifts on specific branches of the legume phylogenetic tree. In this study, time-calibrated phylogenetic trees for a set of species-rich legume clades - Calliandra, Indigofereae, Lupinus, Mimosa and Robinieae - and for the legume family as a whole, are used to explore how we might approach these questions. These clades are analysed using recently developed maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods to detect species diversification rate shifts and test for among-lineage variation in speciation, extinction and net diversification rates. Possible explanations for rate shifts in terms of extrinsic factors and/or intrinsic trait evolution are discussed. In addition, several methodological issues and limitations associated with these analyses are highlighted emphasizing the potential to improve our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of legume diversification by using much more densely sampled phylogenetic trees that integrate information across broad taxonomic, geographical and temporal levels. ?? 2013 South African Association of Botanists.},

abstract = {This study employs three nuclear genes (PHYA, LFY, and GAI1) to reconstruct the phylogenetic and biogeographic history of Magnoliaceae. A total of 104 samples representing 86 taxa from all sections and most subsections were sequenced. Twelve major groups are well supported to be monophyletic within Magnoliaceae and these groups are largely consistent with the recent taxonomic revision at the sectional and subsectional levels. However, relationships at deeper nodes of the subfamily Magnolioideae remain not well resolved. A relaxed clock relying on uncorrelated rates suggests that the complicated divergent evolution of Magnolioideae began around the early Eocene (54.57 mya), concordant with paleoclimatic and fossil evidence. Intercontinental disjunctions of Magnoliaceae in the Northern Hemisphere appear to have originated during at least two geologic periods. Some occurred after the middle Miocene, represented by two well-recognized temperate lineages disjunct between eastern Asia and eastern North America. The others may have occurred no later than the Oligocene, with ancient separations between or within tropical and temperate lineages. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The economically important plum or cherry genus (Prunus) and the subfamily Amygdaloideae of the Rosaceae have a controversial taxonomic history due to the lack of a phylogenetic framework. Phylogenetic analysis using the ITS sequences of nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) was conducted to construct the evolutionary history and evaluate the historical classifications of Prunus and the Amygdaloideae. The analyses suggest two major groups within the Amygdaloideae: (1) Prunus s.l. (sensu lato) and Maddenia, and (2) Exochorda, Oemleria, and Prinsepia. The ITS phylogeny supports the recent treatment of including Exochorda (formerly in the Spiraeoideae) in the Amygdaloideae. Maddenia is found to be nested within Prunus s.l. in the parsimony and distance analyses, but basal to Prunus s.l. in the maximum likelihood analysis. Within Prunus, two major groups are recognizable: (1) the Amygdalus–Prunus group, and (2) the Cerasus–Laurocerasus–Padus group. The clades in the ITS phylogeny are not congruent with most subgeneric groups in the widely used classification of Prunus by Rehder. A broadly defined Prunus is supported.},

abstract = {Aim Ecologists have generally agreed that beta diversity is a key component of global patterns of species richness. Incorporating phylogenetic information into the study of beta diversity allows researchers to identify the degree to which the shared evolutionary histories of species explain ecological patterns observed today. For example, phylogenetic analyses can determine whether closely related species tend to occupy similar positions along broad climatic gradients and whether this explains the compositional turnover along these gradients. Despite the promise of phylogenetic beta diversity analyses, few continental-scale investigations exist. Here, we quantify the phylogenetic beta diversity and taxonomic beta diversity of the angiosperm flora across North America. We relate these metrics to one another and to geographical and environmental distances to uncover the phylogenetic signal underlying species compositional turnover. Location North America. Method Seventy-one regional floras were used and assigned into five latitudinal zones and two longitudinal bands. The S{\o}rensen index and PhyloSor index were used to quantify taxonomic similarity and phylogenetic similarity, respectively, between floras, and were related to geographical and environmental distances. Results Phylogenetic similarity between floras is strongly correlated with taxonomic similarity, is higher in eastern North America than in western North America, and increases strikingly with latitude. Geographical and environmental distances together explained on average about 76{\%} of the variation in phylogenetic beta diversity with environmental distance explaining more variation in phylogenetic similarity in three of the four latitudinal bands examined. Main conclusions The results show that phylogenetic beta diversity is consistently lower than taxonomic beta diversity, which suggests that the spatial turnover of species in the study system is predominantly the spatial turnover of closely related species and not distantly related species. Thus, the turnover of angiosperm floras in North America is best explained by small divergences along environmental axes for closely related species and a gradual turnover of lineages through space.},

abstract = {The extent of gene dispersal is a fundamental factor of the population and evolutionary dynamics of tropical tree species, but directly monitoring seed and pollen movement is a difficult task. However, indirect estimates of historical gene dispersal can be obtained from the fine-scale spatial genetic structure of populations at drift-dispersal equilibrium. Using an approach that is based on the slope of the regression of pairwise kinship coefficients on spatial distance and estimates of the effective population density, we compare indirect gene dispersal estimates of sympatric populations of 10 tropical tree species. We re-analysed 26 data sets consisting of mapped allozyme, SSR (simple sequence repeat), RAPD (random amplified polymorphic DNA) or AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism) genotypes from two rainforest sites in French Guiana. Gene dispersal estimates were obtained for at least one marker in each species, although the estimation procedure failed under insufficient marker polymorphism, limited sample size, or inappropriate sampling area. Estimates generally suffered low precision and were affected by assumptions regarding the effective population density. Averaging estimates over data sets, the extent of gene dispersal ranged from 150 m to 1200 m according to species. Smaller gene dispersal estimates were obtained in species with heavy diaspores, which are presumably not well dispersed, and in populations with high local adult density. We suggest that limited seed dispersal could indirectly limit effective pollen dispersal by creating higher local tree densities, thereby increasing the positive correlation between pollen and seed dispersal distances. We discuss the potential and limitations of our indirect estimation procedure and suggest guidelines for future studies.},

abstract = {Historically, the biodiversity and composition of species in a locality was thought to be influenced primarily by deterministic factors. In such cases, species' niches create differential responses to environmental conditions and interspecific interactions, which combine to determine that locality's biodiversity and species composition. More recently, proponents of the neutral theory have placed a premium on how stochastic factors, such as birth, death, colonization, and extinction (termed "ecological drift") influence diversity and species composition in a locality independent of their niches. Here, I develop the hypothesis that the relative importance of stochastic ecological drift and/or priority effects depend on the harshness of the ecological filter in those habitats. I established long-term experimental ponds to explore the relative importance of community assembly history and drought on patterns of community compositional similarity among ponds that were otherwise similar in their environmental conditions. I show considerable site-to-site variation in pond community composition in the absence of drought that likely resulted from a combination of stochastic ecological drift and priority effects. However, in ponds that experienced drought, I found much higher similarity among communities that likely resulted from niche-selection filtering out species from the regional pool that could not tolerate such environmental harshness. These results implicate the critical role for understanding the processes of community assembly when examining patterns of biodiversity at different spatial scales.},

abstract = {This review is motivated by the true explosion in the number of recent studies both developing and ameliorating probabilistic models of codon evolution. Traditionally parametric, the first codon models focused on estimating the effects of selective pressure on the protein via an explicit parameter in the maximum likelihood framework. Likelihood ratio tests of nested codon models armed the biologists with powerful tools, which provided unambiguous evidence for positive selection in real data. This, in turn, triggered a new wave of methodological developments. The new generation of models views the codon evolution process in a more sophisticated way, relaxing several mathematical assumptions. These models make a greater use of physicochemical amino acid properties, genetic code machinery, and the large amounts of data from the public domain. The overview of the most recent advances on modeling codon evolution is presented here, and a wide range of their applications to real data is discussed. On the downside, availability of a large variety of models, each accounting for various biological factors, increases the margin for misinterpretation; the biological meaning of certain parameters may vary among models, and model selection procedures also deserve greater attention. Solid understanding of the modeling assumptions and their applicability is essential for successful statistical data analysis.},

abstract = {The lizard genus Kentropyx (Squamata: Teiidae) comprises nine species, which have been placed in three species groups (calcarata group, associated to forests ecosystems; paulensis and striata groups, associated to open ecosystems). We reconstructed phylogenetic relationships of Kentropyx based on morphology (pholidosis and coloration) and mitochondrial DNA data (12S and 16S), using maximum parsimony and Bayesian methods, and evaluated biogeographic scenarios based on ancestral areas analyses and molecular dating by Bayesian methods. Additionally, we tested the life-history hypothesis that species of Kentropyx inhabiting open ecosystems (under seasonal environments) produce larger clutches with smaller eggs and that species inhabiting forest ecosystems (under aseasonal conditions) produce clutches with fewer and larger eggs, using Stearns' phylogenetic-subtraction method and canonical phylogenetic ordination to take in to account the effects of phylogeny. Our results showed that Kentropyx comprises three monophyletic groups, with K. striata occupying a basal position in opposition to previous suggestions of relationships. Additionally, Bayesian analysis of divergence time showed that Kentropyx may have originated at the Tertiary (Eocene/Oligocene) and the 'Pleistocene Refuge Hypothesis' may not explain the species diversification. Based on ancestral reconstruction and molecular dating, we argued that a savanna ancestor is more likely and that historical events during the Tertiary of South America promoted the differentiation of the genus, coupled with recent Quaternary events that were important as dispersion routes and for the diversification at populational levels. Clutch size and egg volume were not significantly different between major clades and ecosystems of occurrence, even accounting for the phylogenetic effects. Finally, we argue that phylogenetic constraints and phylogenetic inertia might be playing essential roles in life history evolution of Kentropyx.},

abstract = {Relaxation of selective strength, manifested as a reduction in the efficiency or intensity of natural selection, can drive evolutionary innovation and presage lineage extinction or loss of function. Mechanisms through which selection can be relaxed range from the removal of an existing selective constraint to a reduction in effective population size. Standard methods for estimating the strength and extent of purifying or positive selection from molecular sequence data are not suitable for detecting relaxed selection, because they lack power and can mistake an increase in the intensity of positive selection for relaxation of both purifying and positive selection. Here we present a general hypothesis testing framework (RELAX) for detecting relaxed selection in a codon-based phylogenetic framework. Given two subsets of branches in a phylogeny, RELAX can determine whether selective strength was relaxed or intensified in one of these subsets relative to the other. We establish the validity of our test via simulations and show that it can distinguish between increased positive selection and a relaxation of selective strength. We also demonstrate the power of RELAX in a variety of biological scenarios where relaxation of selection has been hypothesized or demonstrated previously. We find that obligate and facultative $\gamma$-proteobacteria endosymbionts of insects are under relaxed selection compared with their free-living relatives and obligate endosymbionts are under relaxed selection compared with facultative endosymbionts. Selective strength is also relaxed in asexual Daphnia pulex lineages, compared with sexual lineages. Endogenous, non-functional, bornavirus-like elements are found to be under relaxed selection compared with exogenous Borna viruses. Finally, selection on the short-wavelength sensitive, SWS1, opsin genes in echolocating and non-echolocating bats is relaxed only in lineages in which this gene underwent pseudogenization; however, selection on the functional medium/long-wavelength sensitive opsin, M/LWS1, is found to be relaxed in all echolocating bats compared with non-echolocating bats.},

These data provide greatly increased support for the recent additions of Aneulophus, Bhesa, Centroplacus, Ploiarium, and Rafflesiaceae to Malpighiales; sister relations of Phyllanthaceae + Picrodendraceae, monophyly of Hypericaceae, and polyphyly of Clusiaceae. Oxalidales + Huaceae, followed by Celastrales are successive sisters to Malpighiales. Parasitic Rafflesiaceae, which produce the world's largest flowers, are confirmed as embedded within a paraphyletic Euphorbiaceae. Novel findings show a well-supported placement of Ctenolophonaceae with Erythroxylaceae + Rhizophoraceae, sister-group relationships of Bhesa + Centroplacus, and the exclusion of Medusandra from Malpighiales. New taxonomic circumscriptions include the addition of Bhesa to Centroplacaceae, Medusandra to Peridiscaceae (Saxifragales), Calophyllaceae applied to Clusiaceae subfamily Kielmeyeroideae, Peraceae applied to Euphorbiaceae subfamily Peroideae, and Huaceae included in Oxalidales.},

abstract = {The systematic identification of the orthologous features of related organisms greatly facilitates comparative genomics, including research on genome evolution and comparative genetic mapping. In this study, we selected 274 unique gene sequences for the development of PCR-based genetic markers across fifteen legume genomes, representing six crop or model legume species from the phaseoloid and inverted repeat loss clades (IRLC). DNA sequence analysis demonstrated that 129 of the amplified fragments represented single copy loci across most target diploid genomes. The majority of these markers are intron-spanning (70.5{\%}) and linked to legume genetic maps (85.3{\%}). The markers were grouped into four main categories: (1) intron-spanning relatively conserved, (2) intron-spanning diverged, (3) exon-derived conserved, and (4) exon-derived diverged. The extent of sequence divergence within each category indicates that the corresponding markers may have utility for assessing phylogenetic relationships at different, but overlapping, taxonomic levels. We tested marker performance on genomes that had not been previously sampled, representing 95 different species that span the diversity of the Fabaceae. Phylogenetic analyses support the orthology of amplified sequences, with the notable exception of an ambiguous affiliation of Lotus relative to the IRLC and phaseoloid clades.},

abstract = {The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) has been described as a species with low levels of genetic variation. This has been suggested to be the consequence of a demographic bottleneck 10 000-12 000 years ago (ya) and also led to the assumption that only small genetic differences exist between the described subspecies. However, analysing mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites in cheetah samples from most of the historic range of the species we found relatively deep phylogeographic breaks between some of the investigated populations, and most of the methods assessed divergence time estimates predating the postulated bottleneck. Mitochondrial DNA monophyly and overall levels of genetic differentiation support the distinctiveness of Northern-East African cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii). Moreover, combining archaeozoological and contemporary samples, we show that Asiatic cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus venaticus) are unambiguously separated from African subspecies. Divergence time estimates from mitochondrial and nuclear data place the split between Asiatic and Southern African cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus jubatus) at 32 000-67 000 ya using an average mammalian microsatellite mutation rate and at 4700-44 000 ya employing human microsatellite mutation rates. Cheetahs are vulnerable to extinction globally and critically endangered in their Asiatic range, where the last 70-110 individuals survive only in Iran. We demonstrate that these extant Iranian cheetahs are an autochthonous monophyletic population and the last representatives of the Asiatic subspecies A. j. venaticus. We advocate that conservation strategies should consider the uncovered independent evolutionary histories of Asiatic and African cheetahs, as well as among some African subspecies. This would facilitate the dual conservation priorities of maintaining locally adapted ecotypes and genetic diversity.},

abstract = {Mutualistic interactions involving pollination and ant-plant mutualistic networks typically feature tightly linked species grouped in modules. However, such modularity is infrequent in seed dispersal networks, presumably because research on those networks predominantly includes a single taxonomic animal group (e.g. birds). Herein, for the first time, we examine the pattern of interaction in a network that includes multiple taxonomic groups of seed dispersers, and the mechanisms underlying modularity. We found that the network was nested and modular, with five distinguishable modules. Our examination of the mechanisms underlying such modularity showed that plant and animal trait values were associated with specific modules but phylogenetic effect was limited. Thus, the pattern of interaction in this network is only partially explained by shared evolutionary history. We conclude that the observed modularity emerged by a combination of phylogenetic history and trait convergence of phylogenetically unrelated species, shaped by interactions with particular types of dispersal agents.},

abstract = {One signature of adaptive radiation is a high level of trait change early during the diversification process and a plateau toward the end of the radiation. Although the study of the tempo of evolution has historically been the domain of paleontologists, recently developed phylogenetic tools allow for the rigorous examination of trait evolution in a tremendous diversity of organisms. Enemy-driven adaptive radiation was a key prediction of Ehrlich and Raven's coevolutionary hypothesis [Ehrlich PR, Raven PH (1964) Evolution 18: 586-608], yet has remained largely untested. Here we examine patterns of trait evolution in 51 North American milkweed species (Asclepias), using maximum likelihood methods. We study 7 traits of the milkweeds, ranging from seed size and foliar physiological traits to defense traits (cardenolides, latex, and trichomes) previously shown to impact herbivores, including the monarch butterfly. We compare the fit of simple random-walk models of trait evolution to models that incorporate stabilizing selection (Ornstein-Ulenbeck process), as well as time-varying rates of trait evolution. Early bursts of trait evolution were implicated for 2 traits, while stabilizing selection was implicated for several others. We further modeled the relationship between trait change and species diversification while allowing rates of trait evolution to vary during the radiation. Species-rich lineages underwent a proportionately greater decline in latex and cardenolides relative to species-poor lineages, and the rate of trait change was most rapid early in the radiation. An interpretation of this result is that reduced investment in defensive traits accelerated diversification, and disproportionately so, early in the adaptive radiation of milkweeds.},

abstract = {Genome sequencing of the model legumes, Medicago truncatula and Lotus japonicus, provides an opportunity for large-scale sequence-based comparison of two genomes in the same plant family. Here we report synteny comparisons between these species, including details about chromosome relationships, large-scale synteny blocks, microsynteny within blocks, and genome regions lacking clear correspondence. The Lotus and Medicago genomes share a minimum of 10 large-scale synteny blocks, each with substantial collinearity and frequently extending the length of whole chromosome arms. The proportion of genes syntenic and collinear within each synteny block is relatively homogeneous. Medicago-Lotus comparisons also indicate similar and largely homogeneous gene densities, although gene-containing regions in Mt occupy 20-30{\%} more space than Lj counterparts, primarily because of larger numbers of Mt retrotransposons. Because the interpretation of genome comparisons is complicated by large-scale genome duplications, we describe synteny, synonymous substitutions and phylogenetic analyses to identify and date a probable whole-genome duplication event. There is no direct evidence for any recent large-scale genome duplication in either Medicago or Lotus but instead a duplication predating speciation. Phylogenetic comparisons place this duplication within the Rosid I clade, clearly after the split between legumes and Salicaceae (poplar).},

abstract = {Ecological communities characteristically contain a wide diversity of species with important functional, economic and aesthetic value. Ecologists have long questioned how this diversity is maintained. Classic theory shows that stable coexistence requires competitors to differ in their niches; this has motivated numerous investigations of ecological differences presumed to maintain diversity. That niche differences are key to coexistence, however, has recently been challenged by the neutral theory of biodiversity, which explains coexistence with the equivalence of competitors. The ensuing controversy has motivated calls for a better understanding of the collective importance of niche differences for the diversity observed in ecological communities. Here we integrate theory and experimentation to show that niche differences collectively stabilize the dynamics of experimental communities of serpentine annual plants. We used field-parameterized population models to develop a null expectation for community dynamics without the stabilizing effects of niche differences. The population growth rates predicted by this null model varied by several orders of magnitude between species, which is sufficient for rapid competitive exclusion. Moreover, after two generations of community change in the field, Shannon diversity was over 50 per cent greater in communities stabilized by niche differences relative to those exhibiting dynamics predicted by the null model. Finally, in an experiment manipulating species' relative abundances, population growth rates increased when species became rare--the demographic signature of niche differences. Our work thus provides strong evidence that species differences have a critical role in stabilizing species diversity.},

abstract = {The North American plums are a closely related group that are not easily circumscribed, have overlapping morphologies, and are known to hybridize. We previously showed that the North American plums are a closely related, monophyletic group of taxa with little to no cpDNA sequence divergence between taxa. In that study, we came to the unanticipated conclusion that relationships inferred among the taxa contrast sharply with previously defined groups based on morphological characters. Here the aim was to determine if the primary cpDNA haplotypes identified in our earlier study are confined to the taxa in which they were initially observed. The cpDNA rpL16 intron was sequenced for 207 accessions of the 17 North American plum taxa plus Prunus texana. The results show that many taxa contain more than one of the three primary cpDNA haplotypes. Aside from the results found in sect. Prunocerasus, this study has broader implications for phylogenetics in general. The common practice of choosing a single exemplar to represent a taxon can be profoundly misleading in closely related groups. In hindsight, the possibility existed in our earlier study that we could have chosen a different combination of exemplars, which could have resulted in a different inferred phylogeny.},

This is an invaluable opportunity to propose hypotheses about chromosome changes during the family divergence and speciation processes. The chromosome studies showed wide inter-generic, inter and intra-specific variability, as well as marked differences in genome sizes between genera, species and populations. By postulating an ancestral basic number of seven (x=7) it is possible to deduce that polyploid hybrid speciation was very important in the diversification of the family as a whole. Due to increasing and decreasing diploidy processes, secondary basic numbers and modified polyploids series could have arised both at diploid and polyploid levels. On the other hand, recurrent origin of polyploids, occurrence of inter-genomic rearrangements, hybridization and secondary polyploidy are all processes that make it difficult to group the taxa within the Leguminosae family in a natural sequence.},

We provide a probabilistic derivation for the classic, incidence-based forms of these indices and extend this approach to formulate new Jaccard-type or Sorensen-type indices based on species abundance data. We then propose estimators for these indices that include the effect of unseen shared species, based on either (replicated) incidence- or abundancebased sample data. In sampling simulations, these new estimators prove to be considerably less biased than classic indices when a substantial proportion of species are missing from samples. Based on species-rich empirical datasets, we show how incorporating the effect of unseen shared species not only increases accuracy but also can change the interpretation of results.},

Here, I review different algorithms and search strategies used for phylogenetic analysis with the aim of clarifying certain aspects of this important part of the phylogenetic inference exercise. The techniques discussed here apply to both major families of methods based on optimality criteria-parsimony and maximum likelihood-and allow the thorough analysis of complex data sets with hundreds to thousands of terminal taxa. A new technique, called pre-processed searches is proposed for reusing phylogenetic results obtained in previous analyses, to increase the applicability of the previously proposed jumpstarting phylogenetics method.

abstract = {Sequences of the chloroplast ndhF gene and the nuclear ribosomal ITS regions are employed to reconstruct the phylogeny of Prunus (Rosaceae), and evaluate the classification schemes of this genus. The two data sets are congruent in that the genera Prunus s.l. and Maddenia form a monophyletic group, with Maddenia nested within Prunus. However, the ndhF data set is incongruent with the ITS data supporting two major groups within Prunus: one consisting of subgenera Laurocerasus (including Pygeum) and Padus as well as the genus Maddenia and another of subgenera Amygdalus, Cerasus, and Prunus. The ITS data, on the other hand, support a clade composed of subgenera Amygdalus and Prunus and Prunus sect. Microcerasus in addition to a paraphyletic grade of subgenera Laurocerasus and Padus (and the genus Maddenia) taxa. In general, the subgeneric classifications of Prunus s.l. are not supported. The ITS and ndhF phylogenies differ mainly in interspecific relationships and the relative position of the Padus/Laurocerasus group. Both ITS and ndhF data sets suggest that the formerly recognized genus Pygeum is polyphyletic and that the distinction of the subgenera Padus and Laurocerasus is not supported. The biogeographic interactions of the temperate and tropical members in the Padus/Laurocera- sus/Maddenia alliance including Pygeum are shown to be highly dynamic and complex.},

abstract = {The Ceroxyloideae is a small but heterogeneous subfamily of palms (Arecaceae, Palmae). It includes a Caribbean lineage (tribe Cyclospathae), a southern hemisphere disjunction (tribe Ceroxyleae), and an amphi-Andean element (tribe Phytelepheae), until recently considered a distinct subfamily (Phytelephantoideae) due to its highly derived morphology. A variety of hypotheses have been proposed to account for the biogeography of the subfamily, involving Gondwanan vicariance, austral interplate dispersal from South America to Australia via Antarctica, Andean orogeny, and Pleistocene refuges. We assessed the systematic classification and biogeography of the group based on a densely sampled phylogeny using {\textgreater}5.5 kb of DNA sequences from three plastid and two nuclear genomic regions. The subfamily and each of its three tribes were resolved as monophyletic with high support. Divergence time estimates based on penalized likelihood and Bayesian dating methods indicate that Gondwanan vicariance is highly unlikely as an explanation for basic disjunctions in tribe Ceroxyleae. Alternative explanations include a mid-Tertiary trans-Atlantic/trans-African dispersal track and the "lemurian stepping stones" hypothesis. Austral interplate dispersal of Oraniopsis to Australia could have occurred, but apparently only in the mid-Eocene/early Oligocene interval after global cooling had begun. Our data do not support Pleistocene climatic changes as drivers for speciation in the Andean-centered Phytelepheae as previously proposed. Radiation in this tribe coincides largely with the major uplift of the Andes, favoring Andean orogeny over Pleistocene climatic changes as a possible speciation-promoting factor in this tribe. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {For 21 European leaf-floras (with a focus on Central Europe), which span a stratigraphic range from the Late Eocene to the Pliocene, paleoclimate estimates have been calculated using five different quantitative techniques: (a) leaf margin analysis (LMA1), using a regression model based on data from East Asia, (b) the multivariate Climate Leaf Analysis Multivariate Programm (CLAMP) technique, based on data from East Asia and N.-America, (c) a recently developed multivariate technique based on modern European vegetation (ELPA), (d) a provisional LMA regression model based on the vegetation of several wet localities from N.-America (LMA2), and e) the Coexistence Approach (CA), a technique based on comparisons with the nearest living relatives (NLRs) of fossil taxa. According to our results there seems to be certain discrepancies where the different techniques are compared for paleotemperatures estimates, depending mainly on the stratigraphic age of the floras. For Paleogene floras, both multivariate leaf physiognomic techniques are in rather good agreement with CA, although both techniques may differ considerably from each other. In contrast, for the Neogene, CLAMP shows a tendency to produce estimates that are considerably colder than CA, whereas ELPA, provides generally warmer estimates, and is in better agreement with CA and other independent evidence. Our results and interpretations add some caveats to temperature reconstructions based on leaf physiognomy, especially when applied to European floras from older periods (i.e. Paleogene, Cretaceous). Possible changes of the relationship between climate and leaf physiognomy over time should be taken into account as a possible source of error whenever such techniques are used. There is the possibility that the actual correlation between climate and leaf form may be modified by long-time evolutionary responses or floral changes, leading to erroneous paleoclimate estimates, if a calibration data-set is used, which is not suited for the region and time-interval in question. However, further research will be needed to test whether such changes in the relationship between climate and leaf physiognomy over time can also be detected on other continents, or whether this is a problem restricted to Europe. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A large literature concerns the epidemiology of single pathogens on single hosts. Yet in some environmental applications,such as fungal pathogens of forest tree seedlings,the "one host-one pathogen" paradigm may not be applicable. Multiple potential pathogens are often found in a single individual and/or multiple hosts share the same pathogens. Understanding diversity requires techniques to infer how multiple pathogens might regulate multiple hosts and to predict how imp acts might vary with the environment. Here we present a hierarchical framework for the case where there is detection information based on multiple sources(cultures, gene sequencing,and survival observations),and the inference problem includes not only parameters that describe environmental influences on pathogen incidence infection, and host survival, but also on latent states themselves-pathogen incidence at a site and infection statuses of hosts. Due to the large size of the model space, we develop a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo approach to select models, estimate posterior distributions, and predict environmental influences on host survival. we demonstrate with application to a data set involving fungal pathogens on tree hosts,where data include host survival and fungal detection using cultures and DNA sequencing.},

abstract = {The study place is in the Barreirinhas region, Maranh{\~{a}}o State, northeastern Brazil. A vegetation transect of 78 km was studied among four vegetation types: Restinga (coastal vegetation), Cerrado (woody savanna), Cerrad{\~{a}}o (dense woody savanna), and Forest, as well as three forested sites around Lagoa do Ca{\c{c}}{\'{o}}, located approximately 10 km of the transect. Soil profiles in this transect were sampled for $\Delta$13C analysis, as well as buried charcoal fragments were used for 14C dating. The data interpretation indicated that approximately between 15,000 and ∼9000 14C yr B.P., arboreal vegetation prevailed in the whole transect, probably due to the presence of a humid climate. Approximately between ∼9000 and 4000-3000 14C yr B.P., there was the expansion of the savanna, probably related to the presence of drier climate. From ∼4000-3000 14C yr B.P. to the present, the results indicated an increase in the arboreal density in the area, due to the return to a more humid and probably similar climate to the present. The presence of buried charcoal fragments in several soil depths suggested the occurrence of palaeofires during the Holocene. The vegetation dynamic inferred in this study for northeastern Brazil is in agreement with the results obtained in areas of Amazon region, based on pollen analysis of lake sediments and carbon isotope analysis of soil organic matter (SOM), implying than similar climatic conditions have affected these areas during the late Pleistocene until the present. {\textcopyright} 2004 University of Washington.

abstract = {Biologists generally agree that most morphological variation between closely related species is adaptive. The most common method of comparative analysis to test for co-evolved character variation is based on a Brownian-motion model of character evolution. If we are to test for the evolution of character-covariation, and we believe that characters have evolved adaptively to fill niches during an adaptive radiation, then it is appropriate to employ appropriate models for character evolution. We show here that under several models of adaptive character evolution and coevolution during an adaptive radiation, which result in closely related species being more similar to each other than to more distantly related species, cross-species analyses are statistically more appropriate than contrast analyses. If the evolution of some traits fits the Brownian-motion model, while others evolve to fill niches during an adaptive radiation, it might be necessary to identify the number of relevant niche dimensions and the modes of character evolution before deciding on appropriate statistical procedures. Alternatively, maximum-likelihood procedures might be used to determine appropriate transformations of phylogenetic branch lengths that accord with particular models of character evolution.},

abstract = {It is well known that the similarity in species composition between two communities decays with the geographic distance that separates them. It is thus likely that the similarity in the dynamics of two communities also decays with distance, because the distance–decay rela- tionship is fundamental in nature. However, the distance– decay relationships of community dynamics have not yet been revealed. We used transition matrix models to eval- uate distance–decay relationships of seasonal community dynamics (from spring to summer) in rocky intertidal sessile assemblages along the Pacific coast of Japan between 31N and 43N. We evaluated the distance–decay relationships of whole-community dynamics and of three dynamics-related components—recruitment, disturbance, and species interaction (competition and facilitation)—for communities separated by distances ranging from several meters to thousands of kilometers. The similarity of the recruitment dynamics among communities declined rapidly with distance within the fine spatial scale, but only mod- erately within larger scales. The similarity of the disturbance dynamics was independent of distance, and the similarity of species interaction declined slightly with increasing distance. The similarity of whole-community dynamics declined rapidly with distance at a fine spatial scale and moderately at larger scales. The fact that the distance–decay relationship of whole-community dynamics was similar to that of recruitment may suggest that recruitment processes are the most important determinant of spatial variability of community dynamics at our study sites during the study period.},

abstract = {In the conifer genus Juniperus (Cupressaceae), many species are increasing rapidly in distribution, abundance, and dominance in arid and semiarid regions. To help understand the success of junipers in drier habitats, we studied hydraulic traits associated with their water stress resistance, including vulnerability to xylem cavitation, specific conductivity (K(S)), tracheid diameter, conduit reinforcement, and wood density in stems and roots, as well as specific leaf area (SLA) of 14 species from the United States and the Caribbean. A new phylogeny based on DNA sequences tested the relationships between vulnerability to cavitation and other traits using both traditional cross-species correlations and independent contrast correlations. All species were moderately to highly resistant to water-stress-induced cavitation in both roots and shoots. We found strong phylogenetic support for two clades previously based on leaf margin serration (serrate and smooth). Species in the serrate clade were 34-39{\%} more resistant to xylem cavitation in stems and roots than were species in the smooth clade and had ∼35{\%} lower K(S) and 39{\%} lower SLA. Root and stem resistance to cavitation and SLA were all highly conserved traits. A high degree of conservation within clades suggests that hydraulic traits of Juniperus species strongly reflect phylogenetic history. The high resistance to cavitation observed may help explain the survival of junipers during recent extreme droughts in the southwestern United States and their expansion into arid habitats across the western and central United States.},

Vessel length is a key trait that determines plant hydraulic efficiency and safety, yet relatively little is known about this xylem feature. •$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We used previously published studies to generate a new global data set of vessel length in woody plants. These data were used to examine how evolutionary history, plant habit, environment, and growth ring porosity influenced vessel length. We also examined the relationship between mean vessel length and mean vessel diameter and maximum vessel length. •$\backslash$n$\backslash$nKEY RESULTS: Data on mean vessel length were available for stems of 130 species and on maximum vessel length for stems of 91 species. A phylogenetic analysis indicated that vessel length did not exhibit significant phylogenetic signal. Liana species had longer vessel lengths than in tree or shrub species. Vessel diameter was not predictive of mean vessel length, but maximum vessel length strongly predicted mean vessel length. Vessel length did not vary between species that differed in growth ring porosity. •$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Many traits often assumed to be linked to vessel length, including growth ring porosity and vessel diameter, are not associated with vessel length when compared interspecifically. Sampling for vessel length has been nonrandom, e.g., there are virtually no data available for roots, and sampling for environment has been confounded with sampling for habit. Increased knowledge of vessel length is key to understanding the structure and function of the plant hydraulic pathway.},

We sought to develop this relationship by quantifying the extent to which underlying patterns of phylogenetic structure drive interspecific variation among foliar reflectance spectra within three Neotropical canopy tree communities with varying levels of soil fertility. We interpreted the resulting spectral patterns of phylogenetic signal in the context of foliar biochemical traits that may contribute to the spectral-phylogenetic link. We utilized a multi-model ensemble to elucidate trait-spectral relationships, and quantified phylogenetic signal for spectral wavelengths and traits using Pagel's lambda statistic. Foliar reflectance spectra showed evidence of phylogenetic influence primarily within the visible and shortwave infrared spectral regions. These regions were also selected by the multi-model ensemble as those most important to the quantitative prediction of several foliar biochemical traits. Patterns of phylogenetic organization of spectra and traits varied across sites and with soil fertility, indicative of the complex interactions between the environmental and phylogenetic controls underlying patterns of biodiversity.},

abstract = {The three-domains tree, which depicts eukaryotes and archaebacteria as monophyletic sister groups, is the dominant model for early eukaryotic evolution. By contrast, the 'eocyte hypothesis', where eukaryotes are proposed to have originated from within the archaebacteria as sister to the Crenarchaeota (also called the eocytes), has been largely neglected in the literature. We have investigated support for these two competing hypotheses from molecular sequence data using methods that attempt to accommodate the across-site compositional heterogeneity and across-tree compositional and rate matrix heterogeneity that are manifest features of these data. When ribosomal RNA genes were analysed using standard methods that do not adequately model these kinds of heterogeneity, the three-domains tree was supported. However, this support was eroded or lost when composition-heterogeneous models were used, with concomitant increase in support for the eocyte tree for eukaryotic origins. Analysis of combined amino acid sequences from 41 protein-coding genes supported the eocyte tree, whether or not composition-heterogeneous models were used. The possible effects of substitutional saturation of our data were examined using simulation; these results suggested that saturation is delayed by among-site rate variation in the sequences, and that phylogenetic signal for ancient relationships is plausibly present in these data.},

abstract = {Species traits may influence rates of speciation and extinction, affecting both the patterns of diversification among lineages and the distribution of traits among species. Existing likelihood approaches for detecting differential diversification require complete phylogenies; that is, every extant species must be present in a well-resolved phylogeny. We developed 2 likelihood methods that can be used to infer the effect of a trait on speciation and extinction without complete phylogenetic information, generalizing the recent binary-state speciation and extinction method. Our approaches can be used where a phylogeny can be reasonably assumed to be a random sample of extant species or where all extant species are included but some are assigned only to terminal unresolved clades. We explored the effects of decreasing phylogenetic resolution on the ability of our approach to detect differential diversification within a Bayesian framework using simulated phylogenies. Differential diversification caused by an asymmetry in speciation rates was nearly as well detected with only 50{\%} of extant species phylogenetically resolved as with complete phylogenetic knowledge. We demonstrate our unresolved clade method with an analysis of sexual dimorphism and diversification in shorebirds (Charadriiformes). Our methods allow for the direct estimation of the effect of a trait on speciation and extinction rates using incompletely resolved phylogenies.},

abstract = {Phylogenetic relationships of the pantropical family Ebenaceae s.1. were investigated using plastid DNA sequence data from six regions: atpB, matK, ndhF, trnK intron, trnL intron, and trnL-trnF spacer. Sampling included representatives of all currently recognized genera of Ebenaceae, Diospyros, Euclea, and Lissocarpa, and nearly all taxa that were previously recognized at the generic level, e.g., Cargillia, Gunisanthus, Maba, Macreightia, Royena, and Tetraclis. Our results strongly support monophyly of Ebenaceae s.1. and demonstrate that the previous infrafamilar classifications of the family do not circumscribe monophyletic groups. A new infrafamilial classification based on a phylogenetic approach is proposed here and consists of two subfamilies, Lissocarpoideae and Ebenoideae, and four genera, Lissocarpa, Euclea, Royena, and Diospyros. Relationships and potential synapomorphic characters are discussed and summarized. This study supports a western Gondwanan origin of family and indicates that both vicariant and long-distance dispersal events played an important role in attaining current distributions.},

abstract = {Playing a key role in plant growth and development, leaves need to be continuously supplied with water and carbon dioxide to fulfil their photosynthetic function. On its way through the leaf from the xylem to the stomata, water can either move through cell walls or pass from cell to cell to cross the different tissues. Although both pathways are probably used to some degree, evidence is accumulating that living cells contribute substantially to the overall leaf hydraulic conductance (K(leaf)). Transcellular water flow is facilitated and regulated by water channels in the membranes, named aquaporins (AQPs). This review addresses how AQP expression and activity effectively regulate the leaf water balance in normal conditions and modify the cell membrane water permeability in response to different environmental factors, such as irradiance, temperature, and water supply. The role of AQPs in leaf growth and movement, and in CO(2) transport is also discussed.},

abstract = {Today, the Seasonally Dry Tropical Forests (SDTF) of eastern South America occur as large, well-defined nuclei (e.g. Caatinga in the northeast) and as smaller enclaves within other vegetations (e.g. Cerrado and Chaco). In order to infer the way the present SDTF distribution was attained, the genetic structure of Astronium urundeuva, a tree confined to SDTF, was assessed using two chloroplast spacers and nine microsatellite loci. Five haplotypes were identified, whose distribution was spatially structured. The distribution of the two most common and divergent haplotypes suggested former vicariance and progressive divergence due to isolation. More recent range expansions of these two lineages subsequently occurred, leading to a secondary contact at the southern limit of the Caatinga SDTF nucleus. The multilocus-Bayesian approach using microsatellites consistently identified three groups of populations (Northeast, Central and Southwest). Isolation by distance was found in Northeast and Southwest groups whereas admixture was detected in the Central group, located at the transition between Caatinga and Cerrado domains. All together, the results support the existence of range expansions and secondary contact in the Central group. This study provides arguments that favour the existence of a previously more continuous formation of SDTF in eastern South America.},

A strong correlation was found between the geography of the species sampled and their inferred relationships. Species of Maytenus and Gymnosporia from different regions were resolved as polyphyletic groups. Maytenus was resolved in three lineages (New World, African, and Austral-Pacific), while Gymnosporia was resolved in two lineages (New World and Old World). Putterlickia was resolved as nested within the Old World Gymnosporia. Catha edulis (qat, khat) was resolved as sister to the clade of Allocassine, Cassine, Lauridia, and Maurocenia. Gymnosporia cassinoides, which is reportedly chewed as a stimulant in the Canary Islands, was resolved as a derived member of Gymnosporia and is more closely related to Lydenburgia and Putterlickia than it is to Catha. Therefore, all eight of these genera are candidates for containing cathinone- and/or cathine-related alkaloids. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Data referring to a survey of the fish fauna at Floresta Nacional de Canela, a National Conservation Unity located in the upper region of Rio Ca{\'{i}} basin, in higher altitudes of Serra Geral do Rio Grande do Sul are presented in this study. Nine sites were sampled in several aquatic environments, including a swamp, dams and streams situated inside and in the nearby area of the unity. In order to capture the specimens, hand net, seine net, fishing lines, gill nets and baited traps were used. Altogether 20 species were found, belonging to 10 families and 6 orders. Hyphessobrycon luetkenii had a wider distribution, occurring in almost all of the sampled points, while Callichthys callichthys was recorded in only one site. In the dams, the order Perciformes was the most representative, followed by Cypriniformes and Characiformes. These environments are characterized by the dominance of family Cichlidae (Perciformes), of which most of the Neotropical species have preference for stagnant water environments. The occurrence of four exotic introduced species is highlighted (Ctenopharingodon idella, Cyprinus carpio, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and Micropterus salmoides) with distribution restricted to the dams. For the streams, a greater specific richness of Characiformes and Siluriformes of small size was observed, a pattern that had already been found in the South American streams. It is also featured, the presence of species with non defined taxonomic status, such as Trichomycterus sp. and Astyanax aff. scabripinnis, reinforcing the importance of surveys on headwaters streams from Rio Grande do Sul, in order to obtain information to subsidize measures to conserve these environments. Despite the fact that the exotic species were registered only in the dams, their eradication from the conservation unity is recommended, considering the threats that they may represent for the native ichthyofauna and for the other aquatic ecosystems of the region.},

abstract = {Phylogenetic approaches to biogeography are rapidly becoming more so-phisticated. Four types of models are being explored in the literature: (a) diffusion models, (b) island models, (c) hierarchical vicariance models (HVMs), and (d) reticulate models. Diffusion models are used primarily for phylogeographic inference but can also offer insights into geographic dis-continuities of significance on longer time scales. For the island models, statistical approaches are now well developed and typically offer more de-tailed insight than parsimony analysis. In contrast, parsimony may still be the best option for HVM analysis, because existing statistical approaches do not yet accommodate dispersal. The proposed probabilistic models of retic-ulate scenarios remain poorly understood, even though they may currently do the best job of integrating diversification processes into biogeographic analysis. Statistical approaches are gaining in popularity across the field, in part because of the flexibility of stochastic modeling. This allows investiga-tors to address important related processes, such as ecological interactions and climate change, in biogeographic inference.},

abstract = {Question: In a recent re-classification of Amazonian floodplain types, a new category was established for paleo-varzea. Although the geological basis for this classification is sound, a key question iswhether it can be supported by botanical criteria, where floodplain paleo-varzea forests contain distinct tree assemblages compared to othermajor floodplain types. Location: Central Amazonian floodplains, Brazil. Methods: We used 41 tree inventories from floodplain paleo-varzea, varzea and igapo forests to perform a meta-analysis. Diversity and richness estimators were applied at the level of genus and the examination of floristic composition was performed at family and generic levels. Generic composition across the three floodplain types was investigated using GNMDS and cluster analysis. Similarity coefficients and ANOSIMwere applied to quantify floristic resemblance at the generic level between forest types. Indicator species analysis (ISA) was used to identify any indicator genera for the forest types evaluated. Results: Alpha diversity and generic richness in paleo-varzea forest was similar to varzea. Igapo forestwas clearly the least diverse. Family composition was similar across the three forest types; Fabaceae was the dominant family on all three floodplains. Pouteria, Licania and Eschweilera presented the highest importance values in paleo-varzea, but these genera were also important in varzea and igapo. Nevertheless, ANOSIM analyses show that generic composition differed significantly between the three forest types, and a GNMDS ordination and cluster analysis portrays paleo-varzea tree composition as intermediate between varzea and igapo. ISA revealed that Euterpe, Dipteryx and Goupia were the most important indicator genera of paleo-varzea. Conclusions: We conclude that paleo-varzea floodplain tree assemblages are dissimilar to those of varzea and igapo, but contain components typical of both these floodplain types, explaining their intermediate positioning in our analyses. This floral mix probably allows paleo-varzea alpha diversity to be similar to that of varzea.},

abstract = {Evolutionary lineages differ with regard to the variety of forms they exhibit. We investigated whether comparisons of morphological diversity can be used to identify differences in ecological diversity in two sister clades of centrarchid fishes. Species in the Lepomis clade (sunfishes) feed on a wider range of prey items than species in the Micropterus clade (black basses). We quantified disparity in morphology of the feeding apparatus as within-clade variance on principal components and found that Lepomis exhibits 4.4 and 7.4 times more variance than Micropterus on the first two principal components. However, lineages are expected to diversify morphologically and ecologically given enough time, and this pattern could have arisen due to differences in the amount of time each clade has had to accumulate variance. Despite being sister groups, the age of the most recent common ancestor of Lepomis is approximately 14.6 million years ago and its lineages have a total length of 86.4 million years while the age of the most recent common ancestor of Micropterus is only about 8.4 million years ago, and it has a total branch length of 42.9 million years. We used the Brownian motion model of character evolution to test the hypothesis that time of independent evolution of each clade's lineages accounts for differences in morphological disparity and determined that the rates of evolution of the first two principal components are 4.4 and 7.7 times greater in Lepomis. Thus, time and phylogeny do not account for the differences in morphological disparity observed in Lepomis and Micropterus, and other diversity-promoting mechanisms should be investigated.},

Supermatrices can combine existing data directly and in principle provide effective syntheses of phylogenetic information that may reveal new relationships. However, several serious difficulties exist in the construction of large supermatrices that must be overcome before these approaches will enjoy broad utility. We present analyses that examine the performance of sparse supermatrices constructed from large sequence databases for the reconstruction of species-level phylogenies. We develop a largely automated informatics pipeline that allows for the construction of sparse supermatrices from GenBank data. In doing so, we develop strategies for alleviating some of the outstanding impediments to accurate phylogenetic inference using these approaches. These include taxonomic standardization, automated alignment, and the identification of rogue taxa. We use turtles as an exemplar clade and present a well-supported species-level phylogeny for two-thirds of all turtle species based on a approximately 50 kb supermatrix consisting of 93{\%} missing data. Finally, we discuss some of the remaining pitfalls and concerns associated with supermatrix analyses, provide comparisons to supertree approaches, and suggest areas for future research.},

abstract = {Biological similartiy typically decreases with geographical distance. Despite the recent attention to the distance decay relationship, there is no consensus on how the relationship varies across organism groups, geographic gradients and environments. We first conducted a quantitative meta-analysis of 401 distance decay relationships across a wide range of organisms, ecosystems and geographical gradients, and then united the effects of categorical and continuous variables on the rate of distance decay using a general linear model (GLM). As effect sizes we used the similarity at one km distance (initial similarity) and the distance that halves the similarity from its value at one km distance (halving distance). Both the initial similarity and halving distance were significantly affected by variables characterizing the spatial scale, organism properties, study region and ecosystem concerned. The patterns appear robust as the results of meta-analysis and GLM only differed in marginal details. According to GLM with Akaike's information criterion, the most parsimonious models explained 55.3 and 37.6{\%} of variance in initial similarity and halving distance, respectively. Across large scales, similarity was decreasing slightly faster at high latitudes than at low latitudes, while small-scale turnover was higher at low latitudes. We also found significant differences in initial similarity among the realms, with terrestrial systems showing higher small-scale beta diversity. The decrease in community similarity at large scales was higher among organisms that are actively mobile than among passively dispersed organisms. We conclude that regression of similarity against distance unites several ecological phenomena such as dispersal propensity and environmental structuring, and provides an effective approach for gauging the spatial turnover across sites. We also found that the patterns in beta-diversity are highly scale-dependent.},

abstract = {The widespread correspondence between phenotypic variation and environmental conditions, the "fit" of organisms to their environment, reflects the adaptive value of plant functional traits. Several processes contribute to these patterns: plasticity, ecological sorting, and adaptive evolution. This article addresses the importance of ecological sorting processes (community assembly, migration, habitat tracking, etc.) as primary causes of functional trait distributions at the local and landscape level. In relatively saturated communities, plants will establish and regenerate in environments to which they are well adapted, so their distributions, and the distributions of associated functional traits, will reflect the distribution of optimal or near-optimal environmental conditions in space and time. The predicted evolutionary corollary of this process is that traits related to habitat occupancy, e. g., environmental tolerances, will be under stabilizing selection. This process contributes to the widely observed pattern of phylogenetic niche conservatism, i. e., ecological and phenotypic similarities of closely related species. Evidence for niche conservatism in plants is reviewed. Based on Jackson and Overpeck's concept of the realized environment, I propose three scenarios in which a species' distributional responses to environmental conditions will lead to a "mismatch" between its environmental tolerances and the environments it occupies, thus creating opportunities for adaptive evolution: (1) the colonization of "environmental islands" (habitats that are discontinuous in niche space) that require large adaptive shifts in tolerance of one or more environmental factors; (2) the persistence of "trailing-edge" populations in species tracking changing climate, if barriers to dispersal of competitors prevent competitive exclusion in the deteriorating conditions; and (3) responses to changes in the realized environment in multidimensional niche space, in which species are predicted to track environmental factors for which they exhibit narrow tolerances and exhibit adaptive evolutionary response along axes where they exhibit greater niche breadth. These three scenarios provide a conceptual framework that emphasizes the role of ecological sorting processes and stabilizing selection as the context for understanding opportunities for adaptive evolution in heterogeneous and changing environments.},

abstract = {Despite decades of research, it remains controversial whether ecological communities converge towards a common structure determined by environmental conditions irrespective of assembly history. Here, we show experimentally that the answer depends on the level of community organization considered. In a 9-year grassland experiment, we manipulated initial plant composition on abandoned arable land and subsequently allowed natural colonization. Initial compositional variation caused plant communities to remain divergent in species identities, even though these same communities converged strongly in species traits. This contrast between species divergence and trait convergence could not be explained by dispersal limitation or community neutrality alone. Our results show that the simultaneous operation of trait-based assembly rules and species-level priority effects drives community assembly, making it both deterministic and historically contingent, but at different levels of community organization.},

abstract = {The evolution of the eastern Asian and eastern North American disjunction of the witch-hazel genus Hamamelis L. (Hamamelidaceae) was examined through phylogenetic and biogeographic analyses. Phylogenetic relationships of all Hamamelis species were reconstructed using parsimony and Bayesian analyses of sequence data from six plastid (trnL-F, psaA-ycf3, rps16, matK, atpB-rbcL, and psbA-trnH) and two nuclear (ITS and ETS) DNA regions. The phylogeny was then used to infer the biogeographic origin and subsequent diversification using both event-based (DIVA) and maximum likelihood (LAGRANGE) methods incorporating fossil data. The times of divergence within Hamamelis were estimated with the Bayesian approach using the program BEAST. A very low level of molecular variation was detected in both the plastid and the nuclear DNA regions within Hamamelis. The combined analyses resulted in a phylogeny of the genus with higher resolution and support values. Hamamelis was supported to be monophyletic with H. mollis from eastern China diverged first in the genus. All North American species formed a clade and was sister to the eastern Asian H. japonica. Within the North American clade, H. mexicana was sister to H. vernalis, and the recently described species H. ovalis was found to be closely related to the widespread species H. virginiana. The stem age of Hamamelis was estimated to be at the Eocene (51.2 mya, with 95{\%} HDP: 49.0-54.6 mya), and the crown age of the genus was dated to be at the late Miocene (9.7 mya, with 95{\%} HDP: 3.6-18.1 mya, or 10.6 mya, with 95{\%} HDP: 4.2-19.6 mya). The disjunction between the eastern Asian and the eastern North American species was dated to be 7.1 mya (95{\%} HDP: 3.1-13.6 mya) or 7.7 mya (95{\%} HDP: 3.4-13.6 mya). Biogeographic analyses incorporating fossils resulted in more equally possible solutions at the stem lineage of Hamamelis than those including extant species only. Eastern Asia is inferred to be the most-likely area for the origin of Hamamelis. The current disjunction was due to the extinction in western North America and Europe from Eocene to late Miocene, and later migration from eastern Asia into North America. The Bering land bridge was hypothesized to have played an important role in the evolution of this disjunction. The current species diversity of the genus was the result of relatively recent diversification events during the late Miocene rather than long accumulation of lineages from the early Tertiary.},

Latent variable models are important in many fields, including computational biology, natural language processing, and social network analysis. Our perspective is that models are developed iteratively: We build a model, use it to analyze data, assess how it succeeds and fails, revise it, and repeat. We describe how new research has transformed these essential activities. First, we describe probabilistic graphical models, a language for formulating latent variable models.

abstract = {Species originate frequently by natural selection. A general mechanism by which this occurs is ecological speciation, defined as the evolution of reproductive isolation between populations as a result of ecologically-based divergent natural selection. The alternative mechanism is mutation-order speciation in which populations fix different mutations as they adapt to similar selection pressures. Although numerous cases now indicate the importance of ecological speciation in nature, very little is known about the genetics of the process. Here, we summarize the genetics of premating and postzygotic isolation and the role of standing genetic variation in ecological speciation. We discuss the role of selection from standing genetic variation in threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), a complex of species whose ancestral marine form repeatedly colonized and adapted to freshwater environments. We propose that ecological speciation has occurred multiple times in parallel in this group via a "transporter" process in which selection in freshwater environments repeatedly acts on standing genetic variation that is maintained in marine populations by export of freshwater-adapted alleles from elsewhere in the range. Selection from standing genetic variation is likely to play a large role in ecological speciation, which may partly account for its rapidity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The increase of molecular data and the resulting insights into legume systematics make the search for new morphological characters and a careful re-investigation of already stated characters necessary. Bracteoles are small, reduced leaves borne close to the base of lateral branches. Although they seem unimportant in older buds, they have an ecological function in protecting the sepal primordia. Furthermore, a morphogenetic function in mediating the onset of sepal initiation is suspected in the literature. The occurrence of bracteoles varies within Papilionoideae, and their distribution is used in legume systematics. But this is open to criticism, because there is a tendency to use 'absent' for 'caducous'. Thus attention here was paid to the initiation of bracteoles as well as to the sequence of sepal initiation. METHODS: The floral development of 30 taxa out of 15 tribes of Papilionoideae was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). KEY RESULTS: In five taxa the bracteoles initiated, but suppressed early. Furthermore, a broad variability of sepal initiation was found. Besides the widely stated unidirectional pattern, modified unidirectionality, tendencies towards whorled, fully whorled, bidirectional and successive initiation of sepals were all found. CONCLUSION: Initiated but suppressed bracteoles are presented as a 'new' character in Papilionoideae. Considering the presence of bracteoles as a plesiomorphy, their suppression can be seen as a step towards completely reduced bracteoles. The remarkable variability of the sequence of sepal initiation questions the widely stated unidirectionality of organ initiation in Papilionoideae. The different modes of sepal initiation are deducible from the helical pattern of some caesalpinioids, which is seen as a developmental link of the flowers of Papilionoideae and Caesalpinioideae. The bidirectional sepal initiation is possibly a consequence of the morphogenetic function of bracteoles, although bidirectionality is not found in all taxa with reduced bracteoles.},

abstract = {How and why organisms are distributed as they are has long intrigued evolutionary biologists(1-4). The tendency for species to retain their ancestral ecology has been demonstrated in distributions on local and regional scales(5-7), but the extent of ecological conservatism over tens of millions of years and across continents has not been assessed(8-13). Here we show that biome stasis at speciation has outweighed biome shifts by a ratio of more than 25:1, by inferring ancestral biomes for an ecologically diverse sample of more than 11,000 plant species from around the Southern Hemisphere. Stasis was also prevalent in transocean colonizations. Availability of a suitable biome could have substantially influenced which lineages establish on more than one landmass, in addition to the influence of the rarity of the dispersal events themselves. Conversely, the taxonomic composition of biomes has probably been strongly influenced by the rarity of species' transitions between biomes. This study has implications for the future because if clades have inherently limited capacity to shift biomes(13), then their evolutionary potential could be strongly compromised by biome contraction as climate changes.},

I examined a successional gradient of 5-yr, 25-yr and 50-yr-old slope forests, growing in areas once used for subsistence agriculture by the cai{\c{c}}ara people in what is today the Praia do Sul State Biological Reserve on Ilha Grande, Rio de Janeiro state. These areas were compared to a near-climax forest tract located in Ilha Grande State Park. There were 26 species in the 5-yr-old forest and a total basal area of 5.6 m 2 /ha; the 25-yr and 50-yr-old forests and the climax forest had 70 species, 26.3 m 2 /ha; 63 species, 32.4 m 2 /ha; and 134 species, 57.9 m 2 /ha, respectively. Species percentage distribution in ecological groups showed three distinct scenarios: a) dominance of pioneers (5-yr forest); b) dominance of early and late secondary species (25-yr and 50-yr-old forests); and c) dominance of climax species (climax forest). Shannon's Diversity Index for the four areas was 2.51, 3.33, 3.10 and 4.28 nats/ind. The 10 top species according to Importance Value decreased in percentage of total density, frequency and dominance from the 5-yr to the climax forest. The 25-yr and 50-yr-old forests were classified as manmade climax forests because the patterns studied evolved slowly.},

abstract = {The genus Quercus (the oaks) is notorious for interspecific hybrization, generating questions about the mechanisms that permit coexistence of closely related species. Two sister oak species, Quercus virginiana and Q. geminata, occur in sympatry in Florida and throughout the southeastern United States. In 11 sites from northern and southeastern regions of Florida, we used a leaf-based morphological index to identify individuals to species. Eleven nuclear microsatellite markers significantly differentiated between the species with a high correspondence between molecular and morphological typing of specimens. Nevertheless, Bayesian clustering analysis indicates interspecific gene flow, and six of 109 individuals had mixed ancestry. The identity of several individuals also was mismatched using molecular markers and morphological characters. In a common environment, the two species performed differently in terms of photosynthetic performance and growth, corresponding to their divergent ecological niches with respect to soil moisture and other edaphic properties. Our data support earlier hypotheses that divergence in flowering time causes assortative mating, allowing these ecologically distinct sister species to occur in sympatry. Limited gene flow that permits ecological differentiation helps to explain the overdispersion of oak species in local communities.},

abstract = {Reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJ-MCMC) is a technique for simultaneously evaluating multiple related (but not necessarily nested) statistical models that has recently been applied to the problem of phylogenetic model selection. Here we use a simulation approach to assess the performance of this method and compare it to Akaike weights, a measure of model uncertainty that is based on the Akaike information criterion. Under conditions where the assumptions of the candidate models matched the generating conditions, both Bayesian and AIC-based methods perform well. The 95{\%} credible interval contained the generating model close to 95{\%} of the time. However, the size of the credible interval differed with the Bayesian credible set containing approximately 25{\%} to 50{\%} fewer models than an AIC-based credible interval. The posterior probability was a better indicator of the correct model than the Akaike weight when all assumptions were met but both measures performed similarly when some model assumptions were violated. Models in the Bayesian posterior distribution were also more similar to the generating model in their number of parameters and were less biased in their complexity. In contrast, Akaike-weighted models were more distant from the generating model and biased towards slightly greater complexity. The AIC-based credible interval appeared to be more robust to the violation of the rate homogeneity assumption. Both AIC and Bayesian approaches suggest that substantial uncertainty can accompany the choice of model for phylogenetic analyses, suggesting that alternative candidate models should be examined in analysis of phylogenetic data.

abstract = {This is a time of unprecedented transition in DNA sequencing technologies. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) clearly holds promise for fast and cost-effective generation of multilocus sequence data for phylogeography and phylogenetics. However, the focus on non-model organisms, in addition to uncertainty about which sample preparation methods and analyses are appropriate for different research questions and evolutionary timescales, have contributed to a lag in the application of NGS to these fields. Here, we outline some of the major obstacles specific to the application of NGS to phylogeography and phylogenetics, including the focus on non-model organisms, the necessity of obtaining orthologous loci in a cost-effective manner, and the predominate use of gene trees in these fields. We describe the most promising methods of sample preparation that address these challenges. Methods that reduce the genome by restriction digest and manual size selection are most appropriate for studies at the intraspecific level, whereas methods that target specific genomic regions (i.e., target enrichment or sequence capture) have wider applicability from the population level to deep-level phylogenomics. Additionally, we give an overview of how to analyze NGS data to arrive at data sets applicable to the standard toolkit of phylogeography and phylogenetics, including initial data processing to alignment and genotype calling (both SNPs and loci involving many SNPs). Even though whole-genome sequencing is likely to become affordable rather soon, because phylogeography and phylogenetics rely on analysis of hundreds of individuals in many cases, methods that reduce the genome to a subset of loci should remain more cost-effective for some time to come. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The nature and timing of evolution of niche differentiation among closely related species remains an important question in ecology and evolution. The American live oak clade, Virentes, which spans the unglaciated temperate and tropical regions of North America and Mesoamerica, provides an instructive system in which to examine speciation and niche evolution. We generated a fossil-calibrated phylogeny of Virentes using RADseq data to estimate divergence times and used nuclear microsatellites, chloroplast sequences and an intron region of nitrate reductase (NIA-i3) to examine genetic diversity within species, rates of gene flow among species and ancestral population size of disjunct sister species. Transitions in functional and morphological traits associated with ecological and climatic niche axes were examined across the phylogeny. We found the Virentes to be monophyletic with three subclades, including a southwest clade, a southeastern US clade and a Central American/Cuban clade. Despite high leaf morphological variation within species and transpecific chloroplast haplotypes, RADseq and nuclear SSR data showed genetic coherence of species. We estimated a crown date for Virentes of 11 Ma and implicated the formation of the Sea of Cort{\'{e}}s in a speciation event {\~{}}5 Ma. Tree height at maturity, associated with fire tolerance, differs among the sympatric species, while freezing tolerance appears to have diverged repeatedly across the tropical–temperate divide. Sympatric species thus show evidence of ecological niche differentiation but share climatic niches, while allopatric and parapatric species conserve ecological niches, but diverge in climatic niches. The mode of speciation and/or degree of co-occurrence may thus influence which niche axis plants diverge along.},

Frequency shifts might be detectable in neutral genetic markers when stressful conditions cause a population decline. However, frequency shifts that are diagnostic of specific conditions depend on isolating sets of genes that are involved in adaptive responses. Shifts at candidate loci underlying adaptive responses and DNA regions that control their expression have now been linked to evolutionary responses to pollution, global warming and other changes. Conversely, adaptive constraints, particularly in physiological traits, are recognized through DNA decay in candidate genes. These approaches help researchers and conservation managers understand the power and constraints of evolution.},

We demonstrate that simultaneous phylogenetic analyses of chloroplastDNA(matKand rbcL) andnonmolecular characters that include both extant genera and a limited number of fossil taxa provide useful hypotheses for calibrating molecular trees. Root placements varied for Pinaceae, with Bayesian analyses recovering mutually monophyletic subfamilies Pinoideae and Abietoideae and parsimony analyses recovering Abietoideae as paraphyletic by placing the root between Cedrus and the remaining genera. The inferred phylogenetic positions of fossil taxa Pityostrobus bernissartensis as the sister group to Pinus and Pseudolarix erensis as the sister group to extant Pseudolarix were used to guide divergence- time calibrations; these calibrations yielded an Early Cretaceous and an Early Jurassic age for crown-group Pinaceae, respectively. The older age estimates based on Pseudolarix erensis are supported by weaker evidence from the fossil record but are consistent with recent reports of Early Cretaceous leaf fossils that appear to coincide with extant genera. There remains a great need to characterize theanatomyof extantandfossil species andto code additional nonmolecular characters.},

abstract = {Melastomataceae sensu stricto (excluding Memecylaceae) comprise some 3000 species in the neotropics, 1000 in Asia, 240 in Africa, and 230 in Madagascar. Previous family-wide morphological and DNA analyses have shown that the Madagascan species belong to at least three unrelated lineages, which were hypothesized to have arrived by trans-oceanic dispersal. An alternative hypothesis posits that the ancestors of Madagascan, as well as Indian, Melastomataceae arrived from Africa in the Late Cretaceous. This study tests these hypotheses in a Bayesian framework, using three combined sequence datasets analysed under a relaxed clock and simultaneously calibrated with fossils, some not previously used. The new fossil calibration comes from a re-dated possibly Middle or Upper Eocene Brazilian fossil of Melastomeae. Tectonic events were also tentatively used as constraints because of concerns that some of the family's fossils are difficult to assign to nodes in the phylogeny. Regardless of how the data were calibrated, the estimated divergence times of Madagascan and Indian lineages were too young for Cretaceous explanations to hold. This was true even of the oldest ages within the 95{\%} credibility interval around each estimate. Madagascar's Melastomeae appear to have arrived from Africa during the Miocene. Medinilla, with some 70 species in Madagascar and two in Africa, too, arrived during the Miocene, but from Asia. Gravesia, with 100 species in Madagascar and four in east and west Africa, also appears to date to the Miocene, but its monophyly has not been tested. The study afforded an opportunity to compare divergence time estimates obtained earlier with strict clocks and single calibrations, with estimates based on relaxed clocks and different multiple calibrations and taxon sampling.},

Parsimony jackknife results support the hypothesis that Piptadenia is polyphyletic and that there are three independent lineages. The largest groups of species form a monophyletic lineage that is sister to Mimosa and corresponds closely to Piptadenia section Piptadenia sensu Barneby. Three species (P. obliqua, P. moniliformis, and P. leucoxylon) of section Pityrocarpa are sister to species of Pseudopiptadenia in a lineage with Parapiptadenia, Microlobius and Stryphnodendron. Piptadenia viridiflora is distantly related to sects. Piptadenia and Pityrocarpa. Section Piptadenia is characterized by the presence of prickles (aculei), a potential synapomorphy linking it to Mimosa, and exserted, racemose or paniculiform inflorescences of aggregated spikes. Piptadenia viridiflora has stipular spines and 1-2 axillary, spicate primary inflorescences. Species of sect. Pityrocarpa are unarmed trees (sometimes with hardened, persistent stipules) whose flowers have recurved petals and an ovary on a long gynophore. We recommend that Piptadenia viridiflora be removed to a new genus, and that Piptadenia be restricted to the other species of sect. Piptadenia. We resurrect the generic name Pityrocarpa to encompass the Pityrocarpa clade and make the following new combinations: Pityrocarpa moniliformis, Pityrocarpa obliqua ssp. brasiliensis, and Pityrocarpa leucoxylon.},

DESIGN A cross-sectional study. SETTING Nine clinics participating from the Providence Research Network (PRN) comprising 75 physicians serving approximately 200,000 patients. All clinics utilise the Logician EHR for all patient care activities. PATIENTS The study included all PRN patients with an active chart. INTERVENTIONS All patients with a heart failure diagnosis in the problem list were identified by database query. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) data were identified through query of local cardiology and hospital echocardiography databases. Additional LVEF data were sought in a manual search of paper charts. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS To determine the problem list coding accuracy for a heart failure (HF) diagnosis we evaluated sensitivity, positive predictive value and related derived statistical measures using documented LVEF as the 'gold standard'. Of 205 755 active PRN patients, 1731 were identified with a problem list entry of HF. Based on comparison with documented LVEF, the sensitivity for problem list entry was 43.9{\%} and 54.4{\%} when HF was defined as an LVEF {\textless} or = 55{\%} and {\textless} or = 40{\%}, respectively. CONCLUSION The validity of an EHR problem list entry of HF was poor. The problem list validity could be enhanced through reconciliation with other data sources. Inaccurate EHR problem lists may have clinical consequences, including underprescribing of beneficial therapies.},
