abstract = {A key problem in statistical modeling is model selection, that is, how to choose a model at an appropriate level of complexity. This problem appears in many settings, most prominently in choosing the number of clusters in mixture models or the number of factors in factor analysis. In this tutorial, we describe Bayesian nonparametric methods, a class of methods that side-steps this issue by allowing the data to determine the complexity of the model. This tutorial is a high-level introduction to Bayesian nonparametric methods and contains several examples of their application. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Statistical, computational, and algorithmic work on them has been ongoing for four decades, with great advances in understanding. Yet no book has summarized this work until now. Inferring Phylogenies explains clearly the assumptions and logic of making inferences about phylogenies, and using them to make inferences about evolutionary processes. It is an essential text and reference for anyone who wants to understand how phylogenies are reconstructed and how they are used. As phylogenies are inferred with various kinds of data, this book concentrates on some of the central ones: discretely coded characters, molecular sequences, gene frequencies, and quantitative traits. Also covered are restriction sites, RAPDs, and microsatellites. Inferring Phylogenies is intended for graduate-level courses, assuming some knowledge of statistics, mathematics (calculus and fundamental matrix algebra), molecular sequences, and quantitative genetics.},

This article reviews several advantages of Bayesian data analysis over traditional null-hypothesis significance testing. Bayesian methods provide tremendous flexibility for data analytic models and yield rich information about parameters that can be used cumulatively across progressive experiments. Because Bayesian statistical methods can be applied to any data, regardless of the type of cognitive model (Bayesian or otherwise) that motivated the data collection, Bayesian methods for data analysis will continue to be appropriate even if Bayesian models of mind lose their appeal.},

We uncover these patterns from their conditional distribution and use them to summarize data and form predictions. Latent variable models are important in many fields, including computational biology, natural language processing, and social network analysis. Our perspective is that models are developed iteratively: We build a model, use it to analyze data, assess how it succeeds and fails, revise it, and repeat. We describe how new research has transformed these essential activities. First, we describe probabilistic graphical models, a language for formulating latent variable models.

abstract = {Global change challenges forest adaptability at the distributional limit of species. We studied ring-porous Quercus canariensis Willd. xylem traits to analyze how they adjust to spatio-temporal variability in climate. Trees were sampled along altitudinal transects, and annual time series of radial growth (ring width (RW)) and several earlywood vessel (EV) traits were built to analyze their relationships with climate. The trees responded to increasing water constraints with decreasing altitude and changes in climate in the short term but the analyses showed that xylem did not acclimate in response to long-term temperature increase during the past 30 years. The plants' adjustment to climate variability was expressed in a different but complementary manner by the different xylem traits. At low elevations, trees exhibited higher correlations with water stress indices and trees acclimated to more xeric conditions at low elevations by reducing radial growth and hydraulic diameter (D-H) but increasing the density of vessels (DV). Average potential conductivity (K-H) was similar for trees at different altitudes. However, inter-tree differences in xylem traits were higher than those between altitudes, suggesting a strong influence of individual genetic features or micro-site conditions. Trees exhibited higher RW those years with larger D-H and particularly the linear density of vessels (DVl), but partly, climatic signals expressed in RW differed from those in EVs. Trees produced larger D-H after cold winters and wet years. Ring width responded positively to wet and cool weather in fall and spring, whereas the response to climate of DV and K-H was generally opposite to that of RW. These relationships likely expressed the negative impact of high respiration rates in winter on the carbon pools used to produce the EVs in the next spring and the overall positive influence of water availability for trees. Our results showed that trees at different sites were able to adjust their hydraulic architecture to climatic variability and temperature increase during recent decades coordinating several complementary traits. Nonetheless, it should be monitored whether they will succeed to acclimate to future climatic scenarios of increasing water stress.},

abstract = {Woody stems comprise a large biological carbon fraction and determine water transport between roots and leaves; their structure and function can influence both carbon and hydrological cycles. While angiosperm wood anatomy and density determine hydraulic conductivity and mechanical strength, little is known about interrelations across many species. We compiled a global data set comprising two anatomical traits for 3005 woody angiosperms: mean vessel lumen area (Ā) and number per unit area (N). From these, we calculated vessel lumen fraction (F = ĀN) and size to number ratio (S = Ā/N), a new vessel composition index. We examined the extent to which F and S influenced potential sapwood specific stem conductivity (K(S)) and wood density (D; dry mass/fresh volume). F and S varied essentially independently across angiosperms. Variation in K(S) was driven primarily by S, and variation in D was virtually unrelated to F and S. Tissue density outside vessel lumens (D(N)) must predominantly influence D. High S should confer faster K(S) but incur greater freeze-thaw embolism risk. F should also affect K(S), and both F and D(N) should influence mechanical strength, capacitance, and construction costs. Improved theory and quantification are needed to better understand ecological costs and benefits of these three distinct dimensions.},

abstract = {Earlier work on the submergence-tolerant species Rumex palustris revealed that leaf anatomical and morphological changes induced by submergence enhance underwater gas exchange considerably. Here, the hypothesis is tested that these plastic responses are typical properties of submergence-tolerant species. Submergence-induced plasticity in leaf mass area (LMA) and leaf, cell wall and cuticle thickness was investigated in nine plant species differing considerably in tolerance to complete submergence. The functionality of the responses for underwater gas exchange was evaluated by recording oxygen partial pressures inside the petioles when plants were submerged. Acclimation to submergence resulted in a decrease in all leaf parameters, including cuticle thickness, in all species irrespective of flooding tolerance. Consequently, internal oxygen partial pressures (pO(2)) increased significantly in all species until values were close to air saturation. Only in nonacclimated leaves in darkness did intolerant species have a significantly lower pO(2) than tolerant species. These results suggest that submergence-induced leaf plasticity, albeit a prerequisite for underwater survival, does not discriminate tolerant from intolerant species. It is hypothesized that these plastic leaf responses may be induced in all species by several signals present during submergence; for example, low LMA may be a response to low photosynthate concentrations and a thin cuticle may be a response to high relative humidity.},

abstract = {Relaxation of selective strength, manifested as a reduction in the efficiency or intensity of natural selection, can drive evolutionary innovation and presage lineage extinction or loss of function. Mechanisms through which selection can be relaxed range from the removal of an existing selective constraint to a reduction in effective population size. Standard methods for estimating the strength and extent of purifying or positive selection from molecular sequence data are not suitable for detecting relaxed selection, because they lack power and can mistake an increase in the intensity of positive selection for relaxation of both purifying and positive selection. Here we present a general hypothesis testing framework (RELAX) for detecting relaxed selection in a codon-based phylogenetic framework. Given two subsets of branches in a phylogeny, RELAX can determine whether selective strength was relaxed or intensified in one of these subsets relative to the other. We establish the validity of our test via simulations and show that it can distinguish between increased positive selection and a relaxation of selective strength. We also demonstrate the power of RELAX in a variety of biological scenarios where relaxation of selection has been hypothesized or demonstrated previously. We find that obligate and facultative $\gamma$-proteobacteria endosymbionts of insects are under relaxed selection compared with their free-living relatives and obligate endosymbionts are under relaxed selection compared with facultative endosymbionts. Selective strength is also relaxed in asexual Daphnia pulex lineages, compared with sexual lineages. Endogenous, non-functional, bornavirus-like elements are found to be under relaxed selection compared with exogenous Borna viruses. Finally, selection on the short-wavelength sensitive, SWS1, opsin genes in echolocating and non-echolocating bats is relaxed only in lineages in which this gene underwent pseudogenization; however, selection on the functional medium/long-wavelength sensitive opsin, M/LWS1, is found to be relaxed in all echolocating bats compared with non-echolocating bats.},

abstract = {This review summarizes the research on physiological responses to flooding of trees in the seasonal black-water wetland of the Mapire River in Venezuela. Inter-annual variability was found during 8 years of sampling, in spite of which a general picture emerged of increased stomatal conductance (gs) and photosynthetic rate (PN) during the flooded period to values as high as or higher than in plants in drained wet soil. Models explaining the initial inhibitory responses and the acclimation to flooding are proposed. In the inhibitory phase of flooding, hypoxia generated by flooding causes a decrease in root water absorption and stomatal closure. An increase with flooding in xylem water potential ($\psi$) suggests that flooding does not cause water deficit. The PN decreases due to changes in relative stomatal and non-stomatal limitations to photosynthesis; an increase in the latter is due to reduced chlorophyll and total soluble protein content. Total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC) accumulate in leaves but their content begins to decrease during the acclimatized phase at full flooding, coinciding with the resumption of high gs and PN. The reversal of the diminution in gs is associated, in some but not all species, to the growth of adventitious roots. The occurrence of morpho-anatomical and biochemical adaptations which improve oxygen supply would cause the acclimation, including increased water absorption by the roots, increased rubisco and chlorophyll contents and ultimately increased PN. Therefore, trees would perform as if flooding did not signify a stress to their physiology.},

abstract = {One of the most pervasive concepts in the study of community assembly is the metaphor of the environmental filter, which refers to abiotic factors that prevent the establishment or persistence of species in a particular location. The metaphor has its origins in the study of community change during succession and in plant community dynamics, although it has gained considerable attention recently as part of a surge of interest in functional trait and phylogenetic-based approaches to the study of communities. While the filtering metaphor has clear utility in some circumstances, it has been challenging to reconcile the environmental filtering concept with recent developments in ecological theory related to species coexistence. These advances suggest that the evidence used in many studies to assess environmental filtering is insufficient to distinguish filtering from the outcome of biotic interactions. We re-examine the environmental filtering metaphor from the perspective of coexistence theory. In an effort to move the discussion forward, we present a simple framework for considering the role of the environment in shaping community membership, review the literature to document the evidence typically used in environmental filtering studies and highlight research challenges to address in coming years. The current usage of the environmental filtering term in empirical studies likely overstates the role abiotic tolerances play in shaping community structure. We recommend that the term ‘environmental filtering' only be used to refer to cases where the abiotic environment prevents establishment or persistence in the absence of biotic interactions, although only 15{\%} of the studies in our review presented such evidence. Finally, we urge community ecologists to consider additional mechanisms aside from environmental filtering by which the abiotic environment can shape community pattern.},

abstract = {This is a time of unprecedented transition in DNA sequencing technologies. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) clearly holds promise for fast and cost-effective generation of multilocus sequence data for phylogeography and phylogenetics. However, the focus on non-model organisms, in addition to uncertainty about which sample preparation methods and analyses are appropriate for different research questions and evolutionary timescales, have contributed to a lag in the application of NGS to these fields. Here, we outline some of the major obstacles specific to the application of NGS to phylogeography and phylogenetics, including the focus on non-model organisms, the necessity of obtaining orthologous loci in a cost-effective manner, and the predominate use of gene trees in these fields. We describe the most promising methods of sample preparation that address these challenges. Methods that reduce the genome by restriction digest and manual size selection are most appropriate for studies at the intraspecific level, whereas methods that target specific genomic regions (i.e., target enrichment or sequence capture) have wider applicability from the population level to deep-level phylogenomics. Additionally, we give an overview of how to analyze NGS data to arrive at data sets applicable to the standard toolkit of phylogeography and phylogenetics, including initial data processing to alignment and genotype calling (both SNPs and loci involving many SNPs). Even though whole-genome sequencing is likely to become affordable rather soon, because phylogeography and phylogenetics rely on analysis of hundreds of individuals in many cases, methods that reduce the genome to a subset of loci should remain more cost-effective for some time to come. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Community ecology is often perceived as a "mess, "given the seemingly vast number of processes that can underlie the many patterns of interest, and the apparent uniqueness of each study system. However, at the most general level, patterns in the composition and diversity of species--the subject matter of community ecology--are influenced by only four classes of process: selection, drift, speciation, and dispersal. Selection represents deterministic fitness differences among species, drift represents stochastic changes in species abundance, speciation creates new species, and dispersal is the movement of organisms across space. All theoretical and conceptual models in community ecology can be understood with respect to their emphasis on these four processes. Empirical evidence exists for all of these processes and many of their interactions, with a predominance of studies on selection. Organizing the material of community ecology according to this framework can clarify the essential similarities and differences among the many conceptual and theoretical approaches to the discipline, and it can also allow for the articulation of a very general theory of community dynamics: species are added to communities via speciation and dispersal, and the relative abundances of these species are then shaped by drift and selection, as well as ongoing dispersal to drive community dynamics.},

abstract = {For 21 European leaf-floras (with a focus on Central Europe), which span a stratigraphic range from the Late Eocene to the Pliocene, paleoclimate estimates have been calculated using five different quantitative techniques: (a) leaf margin analysis (LMA1), using a regression model based on data from East Asia, (b) the multivariate Climate Leaf Analysis Multivariate Programm (CLAMP) technique, based on data from East Asia and N.-America, (c) a recently developed multivariate technique based on modern European vegetation (ELPA), (d) a provisional LMA regression model based on the vegetation of several wet localities from N.-America (LMA2), and e) the Coexistence Approach (CA), a technique based on comparisons with the nearest living relatives (NLRs) of fossil taxa. According to our results there seems to be certain discrepancies where the different techniques are compared for paleotemperatures estimates, depending mainly on the stratigraphic age of the floras. For Paleogene floras, both multivariate leaf physiognomic techniques are in rather good agreement with CA, although both techniques may differ considerably from each other. In contrast, for the Neogene, CLAMP shows a tendency to produce estimates that are considerably colder than CA, whereas ELPA, provides generally warmer estimates, and is in better agreement with CA and other independent evidence. Our results and interpretations add some caveats to temperature reconstructions based on leaf physiognomy, especially when applied to European floras from older periods (i.e. Paleogene, Cretaceous). Possible changes of the relationship between climate and leaf physiognomy over time should be taken into account as a possible source of error whenever such techniques are used. There is the possibility that the actual correlation between climate and leaf form may be modified by long-time evolutionary responses or floral changes, leading to erroneous paleoclimate estimates, if a calibration data-set is used, which is not suited for the region and time-interval in question. However, further research will be needed to test whether such changes in the relationship between climate and leaf physiognomy over time can also be detected on other continents, or whether this is a problem restricted to Europe. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Photosynthetic systems evolved early in Earth history and have been stable for 2.5??billion years, providing prima facie evidence for the significance of pigments in plant functions. Photosynthetic pigments fill multiple roles from increasing the range of energy captured for photosynthesis to protective functions. Given the importance of pigments to leaf functioning, greater effort is needed to determine whether individual pigments can be identified and quantified in vivo using high fidelity spectroscopy. We review recent advances in detecting plant pigments at the leaf level and discuss successes and reasons why challenges remain for robust remote observation and quantification.

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing for transcript profiling in plants has revealed that alternative splicing (AS) affects a much higher proportion of the transcriptome than was previously assumed. AS is involved in most plant processes and is particularly prevalent in plants exposed to environmental stress. The identification of mutations in predicted splicing factors and spliceosomal proteins that affect cell fate, the circadian clock, plant defense, and tolerance/sensitivity to abiotic stress all point to a fundamental role of splicing/AS in plant growth, development, and responses to external cues. Splicing factors affect the AS of multiple downstream target genes, thereby transferring signals to alter gene expression via splicing factor/AS networks. The last two to three years have seen an ever-increasing number of examples of functional AS. At a time when the identification of AS in individual genes and at a global level is exploding, this review aims to bring together such examples to illustrate the extent and importance of AS, which are not always obvious from individual publications. It also aims to ensure that plant scientists are aware that AS is likely to occur in the genes that they study and that dynamic changes in AS and its consequences need to be considered routinely.},

Freezing or extremely low temperature constitutes a key factor influencing plant growth, development and crop productivity. Plants have evolved a mechanism to enhance tolerance to freezing during exposure to periods of low, but non-freezing temperatures. This phenomenon is called cold acclimation. During cold acclimation, plants develop several mechanisms to minimize potential damages caused by low temperature. Cold response is highly complex process that involves an array of physiological and biochemical modifications. Furthermore, alterations of the expression patterns of many genes, proteins and metabolites in response to cold stress have been reported. Recent studies demonstrate that post-transcriptional and post-translational regulations play a role in the regulation of cold signaling. In this review article, recent advances in cold stress signaling and tolerance are highlighted.},

The latent formulation enables us to consider in a single model combinations of continuous traits, discrete binary traits, and discrete traits with multiple ordered and unordered states. Previous approaches have entertained a single data type generally along a fixed history, precluding estimation of correlation between traits and ignoring uncertainty in the history. We implement our model in a Bayesian phylogenetic framework, and discuss inference techniques for hypothesis testing.

We thus recommend assessing the influence of inorganic carbon and temperature on natural aquatic communities of variable density in addition to studying detached leaves in the scenarios of rising CO2 and temperature. Moreover, a growing number of researchers are interested in tolerance of terrestrial plants during flooding as torrential rains sometimes result in overland floods that inundate terrestrial plants.

abstract = {With increasing concern about the ecological consequences of global climate change, there has been renewed interest in understanding the processes that determine species range limits. We tested a long-hypothesized trade-off between freezing tolerance and growth rate that is often used to explain species range limits. We grew 24 willow and poplar species (family Salicaceae) collected from across North America in a greenhouse common garden under two climate treatments. Maximum entropy models were used to describe species distributions and to estimate species-specific climate parameters. A range of traits related to freezing tolerance, including senescence, budburst, and susceptibility to different temperature minima during and after acclimation were measured. As predicted, species from colder climates exhibited higher freezing tolerance and slower growth rates than species from warmer climates under certain environmental conditions. However, the average relative growth rate (millimeters per meter per day) of northern species markedly increased when a subset of species was grown under a long summer day length (20.5 h), indicating that genetically based day-length cues are required for growth regulation in these species. We conclude that the observed relationship between freezing tolerance and growth rate is not driven by differences in species' intrinsic growth capacity but by differences in the environmental cues that trigger growth. We propose that the coordinated evolution of freezing tolerance and growth phenology could be important in circumscribing willow and poplar range limits and may have important implications for species' current and future distributions.},

An alternative approach is to represent spectra by dissimilarities to other spectra.

Several classification methods for relational representations were developed and found to outperform the nearest-neighbor rule. Existing studies focus only on the performance measured by the classification error. However, for real-time spectral imaging applications, classification speed is of crucial importance. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the computational aspects of the on-line classification of spectra.

A major challenge ahead is to develop models that more explicitly take into account ecology, in particular the interaction of species with each other and with their environment. This will not only improve our understanding of diversification; it will also present a new perspective to the use of phylogenies in community ecology, the science of interaction networks and conservation biology, and might shift the current focus in ecology on equilibrium biodiversity theories to non-equilibrium theories recognising the crucial role of history.},

Growth rate, seed mass, and leaf and stem freezing traits were compared with source minimum temperatures. • Maximum growth rates under tropical conditions were negatively correlated with freezing tolerance under temperate conditions. The minimum source temperature predicted the freezing tolerance of populations under temperate conditions. The tropical species Q. oleoides was differentiated from the three temperate species, and variation among species was greater than among populations. • The trade-off between freezing tolerance and growth rate supports the range limit hypothesis.

abstract = {Model specification remains challenging in spectroscopy of plant biochemistry, as exemplified by the availability of various spectral indices or band combinations for estimating the same biochemical. This lack of consensus in model choice across applications argues for a paradigm shift in hyperspectral methods to address model uncertainty and misspecification. We demonstrated one such method using Bayesian model averaging (BMA), which performs variable/band selection and quantifies the relative merits of many candidate models to synthesize a weighted average model with improved predictive performances. The utility of BMA was examined using a portfolio of 27 foliage spectral-chemical datasets representing over 80 species across the globe to estimate multiple biochemical properties, including nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon, cellulose, lignin, chlorophyll (a or b), carotenoid, polar and nonpolar extractives, leaf mass per area, and equivalent water thickness. We also compared BMA with partial least squares (PLS) and stepwise multiple regression (SMR). Results showed that all the biochemicals except carotenoid were accurately estimated from hyerspectral data with R2 values{\textgreater}0.80. Compared to PLS and SMR, BMA substantially reduced overfitting and enhanced model generalization; BMA also yielded error estimation better indicative of true uncertainties in predictions, when evaluated using a statistic called "prediction interval coverage probability". The relative band importance, which was quantified by band selection probability, differed markedly between BMA and SMR, cautioning the use of SMR for band selection. Computationally, the model calibration with datasets of moderate sizes ({\textgreater}100) was faster for BMA via a hybrid reversible-jump Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampler than for PLS via literal optimization of a cross-validation criterion. Our BMA scheme also provides a generic hierarchical Bayesian framework to assimilate prior knowledge of diverse forms, as illustrated by its use to account for nonlinearity in spectral-chemical relationships. We emphasize that BMA is a competitive, paradigm-shifting alternative to conventional statistical methods and it will find wide use as the virtue of Bayesian inference is increasingly appreciated by the remote sensing community. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Markov models of codon substitution naturally incorporate the structure of the genetic code and the selection intensity at the protein level, providing a more realistic representation of protein-coding sequences compared with nucleotide or amino acid models. Thus, for protein-coding genes, phylogenetic inference is expected to be more accurate under codon models. So far, phylogeny reconstruction under codon models has been elusive due to computational difficulties of dealing with high dimension matrices. Here, we present a fast maximum likelihood (ML) package for phylogenetic inference, CodonPhyML offering hundreds of different codon models, the largest variety to date, for phylogeny inference by ML. CodonPhyML is tested on simulated and real data and is shown to offer excellent speed and convergence properties. In addition, CodonPhyML includes most recent fast methods for estimating phylogenetic branch supports and provides an integral framework for models selection, including amino acid and DNA models.},

abstract = {Bubble formation in the conduits of woody plants sets a challenge for uninterrupted water transportation from the soil up to the canopy. Freezing and thawing of stems has been shown to increase the number of air-filled (embolized) conduits, especially in trees with large conduit diameters. Despite numerous experimental studies, the mechanisms leading to bubble formation during freezing have not been addressed theoretically. We used classical nucleation theory and fluid mechanics to show which mechanisms are most likely to be responsible for bubble formation during freezing and what parameters determine the likelihood of the process. Our results confirm the common assumption that bubble formation during freezing is most likely due to gas segregation by ice. If xylem conduit walls are not permeable to the salts expelled by ice during the freezing process, osmotic pressures high enough for air seeding could be created. The build-up rate of segregated solutes in front of the ice-water interface depends equally on conduit diameter and freezing velocity. Therefore, bubble formation probability depends on these variables. The dependence of bubble formation probability on freezing velocity means that the experimental results obtained for cavitation threshold conduit diameters during freeze/thaw cycles depend on the experimental setup; namely sample size and cooling rate. The velocity dependence also suggests that to avoid bubble formation during freezing trees should have narrow conduits where freezing is likely to be fast (e.g., branches or outermost layer of the xylem). Avoidance of bubble formation during freezing could thus be one piece of the explanation why xylem conduit size of temperate and boreal zone trees varies quite systematically.},

We evaluate TreeZips performance on fourteen tree collections ranging from 2,505 trees on 328 taxa to 150,000 trees on 525 taxa corresponding to 0.6 MB to 434 MB in storage. Our results show that TreeZip is very effective, typically compressing a tree file to less than 2{\%} of its original size. When coupled with standard compression methods such as 7zip, TreeZip can compress a file to less than 1{\%} of its original size. Our results strongly suggest that TreeZip is very effective at compressing phylogenetic trees, which allows for easier exchange of data with colleagues around the world.},

abstract = {The PROSPECT leaf optical model has, to date, combined the effects of photosynthetic pigments, but a finer discrimination among the key pigments is important for physiological and ecological applications of remote sensing. Here we present a new calibration and validation of PROSPECT that separates plant pigment contributions to the visible spectrum using several comprehensive datasets containing hundreds of leaves collected in a wide range of ecosystem types. These data include leaf biochemical (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, carotenoids, water, and dry matter) and optical properties (directional-hemispherical reflectance and transmittance measured from 400 nm to 2450 nm). We first provide distinct in vivo specific absorption coefficients for each biochemical constituent and determine an average refractive index of the leaf interior. Then we invert the model on independent datasets to check the prediction of the biochemical content of intact leaves. The main result of this study is that the new chlorophyll and carotenoid specific absorption coefficients agree well with available in vitro absorption spectra, and that the new refractive index displays interesting spectral features in the visible, in accordance with physical principles. Moreover, we improve the chlorophyll estimation (RMSE = 9 $\mu$g/cm2) and obtain very encouraging results with carotenoids (RMSE = 3 $\mu$g/cm2). Reconstruction of reflectance and transmittance in the 400-2450 nm wavelength domain using PROSPECT is also excellent, with small errors and low to negligible biases. Improvements are particularly noticeable for leaves with low pigment content. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Comparative methods used to study patterns of evolutionary change in a continuous trait on a phylogeny range from Brownian motion processes to models where the trait is assumed to evolve according to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process. Although these models have proved useful in a variety of contexts, they still do not cover all the scenarios biologists want to examine. For models based on the OU process, model complexity is restricted in current implementations by assuming that the rate of stochastic motion and the strength of selection do not vary among selective regimes. Here, we expand the OU model of adaptive evolution to include models that variously relax the assumption of a constant rate and strength of selection. In its most general form, the methods described here can assign each selective regime a separate trait optimum, a rate of stochastic motion parameter, and a parameter for the strength of selection. We use simulations to show that our models can detect meaningful differences in the evolutionary process, especially with larger sample sizes. We also illustrate our method using an empirical example of genome size evolution within a large flowering plant clade.},

abstract = {Plants are subjected to extended periods of waterlogging and submersion in the floodplains of Central Amazonia. Several adaptations and growth strategies allow them to survive. In this study, germination and seedling growth of seeds of six tree species from nutrient-rich v??rzea and six from nutrient-poor igap?? were analysed in the Amazon Research Institute (INPA) in Manaus, Brazil. Germination rates and duration were lower in species from v??rzea than from igap??. The cotyledons opened later and had lower longevity in v??rzea, where the environment provides sufficient nutrients to the establishing seedling and there is less need for nutrient supply by the mother plant. Species from v??rzea produced smaller seeds and the seedlings tended to grow less than in igap?? where large-seeded species predominated. Mortality of waterlogged and submerged seedlings was low in all species, except in submerged seedlings of Senna reticulata. Leaf production and shedding was continuous in the v??rzea species, but in the species from igap?? leaves had higher longevity. An explanation for the dynamic leaf phenology in v??rzea might be that this is an adaptation against the high sediment load which covers the leaves and impedes photosynthetic activity. Morphological adaptations to flooding (adventitious roots, lenticels, stem hypertrophy) occurred only in waterlogged seedlings from v??rzea species, maybe as a consequence of the oxygen deficiencies in the rhizosphere caused by the high plant productivity and decomposition in this ecosystem. The production of morphological adaptations might be limited by the low nutrient availability in igap??. The differences in germination and growth in v??rzea and igap?? may be responses to the different nutrient availabilities in the two ecosystems and thus represent different survival strategies. In v??rzea, morphological adaptations which require high nutrient supply allow the plants to maintain growth and photosynthetic activity at high levels, even during waterlogging. Igap?? species have a fast initial growth and constant leaf production, investing in high seed mass, leaf sclerophylly and reduced leaf loss. They tend to remain in a state of rest during flooding. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Recent technological advances for assessing optical properties of plants offer opportunities to detect functional traits of organisms and differentiate levels of biological organization across the tree of life. Here we connect leaf-level full range spectral data (400-2400 nm) of leaves to the hierarchical organization of plant diversity within the oak genus (Quercus) using field and greenhouse experiments in which environmental factors and plant age are controlled. We show that spectral data significantly differentiate populations within a species and that spectral similarity is significantly associated with phylogenetic similarity among species. We further show that hyperspectral information allows more accurate classification of taxa than spectrally-derived traits, which by definition are of lower dimensionality. Finally, model accuracy increases at higher levels in the hierarchical organization of plant diversity, such that we are able to better distinguish clades than species or populations. This pattern supports an evolutionary explanation for the degree of optical differentiation among plants and demonstrates potential for remote detection of genetic and phylogenetic diversity.},

Empirical studies often seek to investigate the relationship between genetic differentiation and some ecological variable(s) while accounting for geographic distance, but common approaches to this problem (such as the partial Mantel test) have a number of drawbacks. In this article, we present a Bayesian method that enables users to quantify the relative contributions of geographic distance and ecological distance to genetic differentiation between sampled populations or individuals. We model the allele frequencies in a set of populations at a set of unlinked loci as spatially correlated Gaussian processes, in which the covariance structure is a decreasing function of both geographic and ecological distance. Parameters of the model are estimated using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We call this method Bayesian Estimation of Differentiation in Alleles by Spatial Structure and Local Ecology (BEDASSLE), and have implemented it in a user-friendly format in the statistical platform R. We demonstrate its utility with a simulation study and empirical applications to human and teosinte data sets.},

abstract = {While the fundamental trade-off in leaf traits related to carbon capture as described by the leaf economics spectrum is well-established among plant species, the relationship of the leaf economics spectrum to stem hydraulics is much less known. Since carbon capture and transpiration are coupled, a close connection between leaf traits and stem hydraulics should be expected. We thus asked whether xylem traits that describe drought tolerance and vulnerability to cavitation are linked to particular leaf traits. We assessed xylem vulnerability, using the pressure sleeve technique, and anatomical xylem characteristics in 39 subtropical tree species grown under common garden conditions in the BEF-China experiment and tested for correlations with traits related to the leaf economics spectrum as well as to stomatal control, including maximum stomatal conductance, vapor pressure deficit at maximum stomatal conductance and vapor pressure deficit at which stomatal conductance is down-regulated. Our results revealed that specific xylem hydraulic conductivity and cavitation resistance were closely linked to traits represented in the leaf economic spectrum, in particular to leaf nitrogen concentration, as well as to log leaf area and leaf carbon to nitrogen ratio but not to any parameter of stomatal conductance. The study highlights the potential use of well-known leaf traits from the leaf economics spectrum to predict plant species' drought resistance.},

abstract = {Recent functional trait studies have shown that trait differences may favour certain species (environmental filtering) while simultaneously preventing competitive exclusion (niche partitioning). However, phenomenological trait-dispersion analyses do not identify the mechanisms that generate niche partitioning, preventing trait-based prediction of future changes in biodiversity. We argue that such predictions require linking functional traits with recognised coexistence mechanisms involving spatial or temporal environmental heterogeneity, resource partitioning and natural enemies. We first demonstrate the limitations of phenomenological approaches using simulations, and then (1) propose trait-based tests of coexistence, (2) generate hypotheses about which plant functional traits are likely to interact with particular mechanisms and (3) review the literature for evidence for these hypotheses. Theory and data suggest that all four classes of coexistence mechanisms could act on functional trait variation, but some mechanisms will be stronger and more widespread than others. The highest priority for future research is studies of interactions between environmental heterogeneity and trait variation that measure environmental variables at within-community scales and quantify species' responses to the environment in the absence of competition. Evidence that similar trait-based coexistence mechanisms operate in many ecosystems would simplify biodiversity forecasting and represent a rare victory for generality over contingency in community ecology.},

abstract = {Shifts in rainfall patterns and increasing temperatures associated with climate change are likely to cause widespread forest decline in regions where droughts are predicted to increase in duration and severity. One primary cause of productivity loss and plant mortality during drought is hydraulic failure. Drought stress creates trapped gas emboli in the water transport system, which reduces the ability of plants to supply water to leaves for photosynthetic gas exchange and can ultimately result in desiccation and mortality. At present we lack a clear picture of how thresholds to hydraulic failure vary across a broad range of species and environments, despite many individual experiments. Here we draw together published and unpublished data on the vulnerability of the transport system to drought-induced embolism for a large number of woody species, with a view to examining the likely consequences of climate change for forest biomes. We show that 70{\%} of 226 forest species from 81 sites worldwide operate with narrow ({\textless}1 megapascal) hydraulic safety margins against injurious levels of drought stress and therefore potentially face long-term reductions in productivity and survival if temperature and aridity increase as predicted for many regions across the globe. Safety margins are largely independent of mean annual precipitation, showing that there is global convergence in the vulnerability of forests to drought, with all forest biomes equally vulnerable to hydraulic failure regardless of their current rainfall environment. These findings provide insight into why drought-induced forest decline is occurring not only in arid regions but also in wet forests not normally considered at drought risk.},

LIBERTY provides a simulation, at a fine spectral resolution, of quasiinfinite leaf reflectance (as represented by stacked leaves) and single leaf reflectance. Single leaf reflectance and transmittance are important input variables to vegetation canopy reflectance models. A prototype parameterization of LIBERTY was based upon measurements of pine needles mid known absorption coefficients of pure component leaf biochemicals. The estimated infinite-reflectance output was compared with the spectra of both dried and fresh pine needles with root mean square errors (RMSE) of 2.87{\%} and 1.73{\%}, respectively. The comparisons between measured and estimated reflectance and transmittance values for single needles were also very accurate with RSME of 1.84{\%} and 1.12{\%}, respectively. Initial inversion studies have demonstrated that significant improvements can be made to LIBERTY by utilizing in vivo absorption coefficients which have been determined by the inversion process. These results demonstrate the capability of LIBERTY to model accurately the spectral response, of pine needles.},

abstract = {Maps of upper-level and surface winds and of surface temperature and precipitation illustrate the results of a sequence of global paleoclimatic simulations spanning the past 21,000 yr for North America. We review (a) the large-scale features of circulation, temperature, and precipitation that appear in the simulations from the NCAR Community Climate Model Version 1 (CCM 1), (b) the implications of the simulated climate for the past continental-scale distributions of three plant taxa (Picea spp., Pseudotsuga menziesii, and Artemisia tridentata), which are broadly representative of the vegetation across the continent, and (c) the potential explanations in terms of atmospheric circulation or surface energy- and water-balance processes for mismatches between the simulations and observations. Most of the broad-scale features of previous paleoclimatic simulations with the NCAR CCM 0 for North America are present in the current simulations. Many of the elements of a conceptual model (based on previous climate simulations) that describes the controls of paleoclimatic variations across North America during the past 21,000 yr are found in simulations reviewed here. These include (1) displacement of the jet stream by the Laurentide Ice Sheet to the south of its present position in both winter and summer, (2) generation of a 'glacial anticyclone' over the ice sheet at the LGM, and the consequent induction of large-scale sinking motions induced over eastern North America, (3) changes in the strength of surface atmospheric circulation features through time, including weakening of the Aleutian low in winter, and strengthening of the eastern Pacific and Bermuda high-pressure systems in summer as the ice sheet decreased in size, (4) development of a 'heat low' at the surface and a strengthened ridge in the upper-atmosphere over the continent at the time of the maximum summer insolation anomaly, (5) increases in summer temperature earlier in regions remote from the ice sheet (these increases appear earlier in the present (CCM 1) simulations than in the previous (CCM 0) ones, however), and (6) continuation of negative winter temperature anomalies into the middle Holocene. In general, simulated surface conditions that are discordant with paleoenvironmental observations can be attributed to the simulation of particular atmospheric circulation patterns (e.g. those that suppress precipitation or advect warm air into a region), with these mismatches amplified in Beringia and the southeastern United States by surface energy- and water-balance processes.},

abstract = {Temperate climates are defined by distinct temperature seasonality with large and often unpredictable weather during any of the four seasons. To thrive in such climates, trees have to withstand a cold winter and the stochastic occurrence of freeze events during any time of the year. The physiological mechanisms trees adopt to escape, avoid, and tolerate freezing temperatures include a cold acclimation in autumn, a dormancy period during winter (leafless in deciduous trees), and the maintenance of a certain freezing tolerance during dehardening in early spring. The change from one phase to the next is mediated by complex interactions between temperature and photoperiod. This review aims at providing an overview of the interplay between phenology of leaves and species-specific freezing resistance. First, we address the long-term evolutionary responses that enabled temperate trees to tolerate certain low temperature extremes. We provide evidence that short term acclimation of freezing resistance plays a crucial role both in dormant and active buds, including re-acclimation to cold conditions following warm spells. This ability declines to almost zero during leaf emergence. Second, we show that the risk that native temperate trees encounter freeze injuries is low and is confined to spring and underline that this risk might be altered by climate warming depending on species-specific phenological responses to environmental cues.},

However, frequency shifts that are diagnostic of specific conditions depend on isolating sets of genes that are involved in adaptive responses. Shifts at candidate loci underlying adaptive responses and DNA regions that control their expression have now been linked to evolutionary responses to pollution, global warming and other changes. Conversely, adaptive constraints, particularly in physiological traits, are recognized through DNA decay in candidate genes. These approaches help researchers and conservation managers understand the power and constraints of evolution.},

Ring-porous species had the greatest network conductance and this value increased isometrically with trunk basal area, indicating that conductance per unit sapwood was independent of tree size.

Here, we utilize next-generation sequencing of restriction-site associated DNA (RAD-Seq) to resolve a framework phylogeny of a predominantly American clade of oaks whose crown age is estimated at 23-33 million years old. Using a recently developed analytical pipeline for RAD-Seq phylogenetics, we created a concatenated matrix of 1.40 E06 aligned nucleotides, constituting 27,727 sequence clusters. RAD-Seq data were readily combined across runs, with no difference in phylogenetic placement between technical replicates, which overlapped by only 43-64{\%} in locus coverage. 17{\%} (4,715) of the loci we analyzed could be mapped with high confidence to one or more expressed sequence tags in NCBI Genbank. A concatenated matrix of the loci that BLAST to at least one EST sequence provides approximately half as many variable or parsimony-informative characters as equal-sized datasets from the non-EST loci. The EST-associated matrix is more complete (fewer missing loci) and has slightly lower homoplasy than non-EST subsampled matrices of the same size, but there is no difference in phylogenetic support or relative attribution of base substitutions to internal versus terminal branches of the phylogeny. We introduce a partitioned RAD visualization method (implemented in the R package RADami; http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RADami) to investigate the possibility that suboptimal topologies supported by large numbers of loci--due, for example, to reticulate evolution or lineage sorting--are masked by the globally optimal tree. We find no evidence for strongly-supported alternative topologies in our study, suggesting that the phylogeny we recover is a robust estimate of large-scale phylogenetic patterns in the American oak clade. Our study is one of the first to demonstrate the utility of RAD-Seq data for inferring phylogeny in a 23-33 million year-old clade.},

abstract = {Early flowering plants are thought to have been woody species restricted to warm habitats. This lineage has since radiated into almost every climate, with manifold growth forms. As angiosperms spread and climate changed, they evolved mechanisms to cope with episodic freezing. To explore the evolution of traits underpinning the ability to persist in freezing conditions, we assembled a large species-level database of growth habit (woody or herbaceous; 49,064 species), as well as leaf phenology (evergreen or deciduous), diameter of hydraulic conduits (that is, xylem vessels and tracheids) and climate occupancies (exposure to freezing). To model the evolution of species' traits and climate occupancies, we combined these data with an unparalleled dated molecular phylogeny (32,223 species) for land plants. Here we show that woody clades successfully moved into freezing-prone environments by either possessing transport networks of small safe conduits and/or shutting down hydraulic function by dropping leaves during freezing. Herbaceous species largely avoided freezing periods by senescing cheaply constructed aboveground tissue. Growth habit has long been considered labile, but we find that growth habit was less labile than climate occupancy. Additionally, freezing environments were largely filled by lineages that had already become herbs or, when remaining woody, already had small conduits (that is, the trait evolved before the climate occupancy). By contrast, most deciduous woody lineages had an evolutionary shift to seasonally shedding their leaves only after exposure to freezing (that is, the climate occupancy evolved before the trait). For angiosperms to inhabit novel cold environments they had to gain new structural and functional trait solutions; our results suggest that many of these solutions were probably acquired before their foray into the cold.},

abstract = {We consider three approaches for estimating the rates of nonsynonymous and synonymous changes at each site in a sequence alignment in order to identify sites under positive or negative selection: (1) a suite of fast likelihood-based "counting methods" that employ either a single most likely ancestral reconstruction, weighting across all possible ancestral reconstructions, or sampling from ancestral reconstructions; (2) a random effects likelihood (REL) approach, which models variation in nonsynonymous and synonymous rates across sites according to a predefined distribution, with the selection pressure at an individual site inferred using an empirical Bayes approach; and (3) a fixed effects likelihood (FEL) method that directly estimates nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates at each site. All three methods incorporate flexible models of nucleotide substitution bias and variation in both nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates across sites, facilitating the comparison between the methods. We demonstrate that the results obtained using these approaches show broad agreement in levels of Type I and Type II error and in estimates of substitution rates. Counting methods are well suited for large alignments, for which there is high power to detect positive and negative selection, but appear to underestimate the substitution rate. A REL approach, which is more computationally intensive than counting methods, has higher power than counting methods to detect selection in data sets of intermediate size but may suffer from higher rates of false positives for small data sets. A FEL approach appears to capture the pattern of rate variation better than counting methods or random effects models, does not suffer from as many false positives as random effects models for data sets comprising few sequences, and can be efficiently parallelized. Our results suggest that previously reported differences between results obtained by counting methods and random effects models arise due to a combination of the conservative nature of counting-based methods, the failure of current random effects models to allow for variation in synonymous substitution rates, and the naive application of random effects models to extremely sparse data sets. We demonstrate our methods on sequence data from the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 env and pol genes and simulated alignments.},

abstract = {Phylogenetic approaches to biogeography are rapidly becoming more so-phisticated. Four types of models are being explored in the literature: (a) diffusion models, (b) island models, (c) hierarchical vicariance models (HVMs), and (d) reticulate models. Diffusion models are used primarily for phylogeographic inference but can also offer insights into geographic dis-continuities of significance on longer time scales. For the island models, statistical approaches are now well developed and typically offer more de-tailed insight than parsimony analysis. In contrast, parsimony may still be the best option for HVM analysis, because existing statistical approaches do not yet accommodate dispersal. The proposed probabilistic models of retic-ulate scenarios remain poorly understood, even though they may currently do the best job of integrating diversification processes into biogeographic analysis. Statistical approaches are gaining in popularity across the field, in part because of the flexibility of stochastic modeling. This allows investiga-tors to address important related processes, such as ecological interactions and climate change, in biogeographic inference.},

abstract = {Question: In a recent re-classification of Amazonian floodplain types, a new category was established for paleo-varzea. Although the geological basis for this classification is sound, a key question iswhether it can be supported by botanical criteria, where floodplain paleo-varzea forests contain distinct tree assemblages compared to othermajor floodplain types. Location: Central Amazonian floodplains, Brazil. Methods: We used 41 tree inventories from floodplain paleo-varzea, varzea and igapo forests to perform a meta-analysis. Diversity and richness estimators were applied at the level of genus and the examination of floristic composition was performed at family and generic levels. Generic composition across the three floodplain types was investigated using GNMDS and cluster analysis. Similarity coefficients and ANOSIMwere applied to quantify floristic resemblance at the generic level between forest types. Indicator species analysis (ISA) was used to identify any indicator genera for the forest types evaluated. Results: Alpha diversity and generic richness in paleo-varzea forest was similar to varzea. Igapo forestwas clearly the least diverse. Family composition was similar across the three forest types; Fabaceae was the dominant family on all three floodplains. Pouteria, Licania and Eschweilera presented the highest importance values in paleo-varzea, but these genera were also important in varzea and igapo. Nevertheless, ANOSIM analyses show that generic composition differed significantly between the three forest types, and a GNMDS ordination and cluster analysis portrays paleo-varzea tree composition as intermediate between varzea and igapo. ISA revealed that Euterpe, Dipteryx and Goupia were the most important indicator genera of paleo-varzea. Conclusions: We conclude that paleo-varzea floodplain tree assemblages are dissimilar to those of varzea and igapo, but contain components typical of both these floodplain types, explaining their intermediate positioning in our analyses. This floral mix probably allows paleo-varzea alpha diversity to be similar to that of varzea.},

abstract = {Patterns of species richness reflect the balance between speciation and extinction over the evolutionary history of life. These processes are influenced by the size and geographical complexity of regions, conditions of the environment, and attributes of individuals and species. Diversity within clades also depends on age and thus the time available for accumulating species. Estimating rates of diversification is key to understanding how these factors have shaped patterns of species richness. Several approaches to calculating both relative and absolute rates of speciation and extinction within clades are based on phylogenetic reconstructions of evolutionary relationships. As the size and quality of phylogenies increases, these approaches will find broader application. However, phylogeny reconstruction fosters a perceptual bias of continual increase in species richness, and the analysis of primarily large clades produces a data selection bias. Recognizing these biases will encourage the development of more realistic models of diversification and the regulation of species richness. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Plant responses to cold stress are mediated by a transcriptional cascade, in which the transcription factor ICE1 and possibly related proteins activate the expression of C-repeat (CRT)-binding factors (CBFs), leading to the transcription of downstream effector genes. The variant RING finger protein high expression of osmotically responsive gene (HOS)1 was identified genetically as a negative regulator of cold responses. We present evidence here that HOS1 is an E3 ligase required for the ubiquitination of ICE1. HOS1 physically interacts with ICE1 and mediates the ubiquitination of ICE1 both in vitro and in vivo. We found that cold induces the degradation of ICE1 in plants, and this degradation requires HOS1. Consistent with enhanced cold-responsive gene expression in loss-of-function hos1 mutant plants, overexpression of HOS1 represses the expression of CBFs and their downstream genes and confers increased sensitivity to freezing stress. Our results indicate that cold stress responses in Arabidopsis are attenuated by a ubiquitination/proteasome pathway in which HOS1 mediates the degradation of the ICE1 protein.},

abstract = {How biological diversity is generated and maintained is a fundamental question in ecology. Ecologists have delineated many mechanisms that can, in principle, favor species coexistence and hence maintain biodiversity. Most such coexistence mechanisms require or imply tradeoffs between different aspects of species performance. However, it remains unknown whether simple functional tradeoffs underlie coexistence mechanisms in diverse natural systems. We show that functional tradeoffs explain species differences in long-term population dynamics that are associated with recovery from low density (and hence coexistence) for a community of winter annual plants in the Sonoran Desert. We develop a new general framework for quantifying the magnitude of coexistence via the storage effect and use this framework to assess the strength of the storage effect in the winter annual community. We then combine a 25-year record of vital rates with morphological and physiological measurements to identify functional differences between species in the growth and reproductive phase of the life cycle that promote storage-effect coexistence. Separation of species along a tradeoff between growth capacity and low-resource tolerance corresponds to differences in demographic responses to environmental variation across years. Growing season precipitation is one critical environmental variable underlying the demographic decoupling of species. These results demonstrate how partially decoupled population dynamics that promote local biodiversity are associated with physiological differences in resource uptake and allocation between species. These results for a relatively simple system demonstrate how long-term community dynamics relate to functional biology, a linkage scientists have long sought for more complex systems.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Flooding causes substantial stress for terrestrial plants, particularly if the floodwater completely submerges the shoot. The main problems during submergence are shortage of oxygen due to the slow diffusion rates of gases in water, and depletion of carbohydrates, which is the substrate for respiration. These two factors together lead to loss of biomass and eventually death of the submerged plants. Although conditions under water are unfavourable with respect to light and carbon dioxide supply, photosynthesis may provide both oxygen and carbohydrates, resulting in continuation of aerobic respiration. SCOPE: This review focuses on evidence in the literature that photosynthesis contributes to survival of terrestrial plants during complete submergence. Furthermore, we discuss relevant morphological and physiological responses of the shoot of terrestrial plant species that enable the positive effects of light on underwater plant performance. CONCLUSIONS: Light increases the survival of terrestrial plants under water, indicating that photosynthesis commonly occurs under these submerged conditions. Such underwater photosynthesis increases both internal oxygen concentrations and carbohydrate contents, compared with plants submerged in the dark, and thereby alleviates the adverse effects of flooding. Additionally, several terrestrial species show high plasticity with respect to their leaf development. In a number of species, leaf morphology changes in response to submergence, probably to facilitate underwater gas exchange. Such increased gas exchange may result in higher assimilation rates, and lower carbon dioxide compensation points under water, which is particularly important at the low carbon dioxide concentrations observed in the field. As a result of higher internal carbon dioxide concentrations in submergence-acclimated plants, underwater photorespiration rates are expected to be lower than in non-acclimated plants. Furthermore, the regulatory mechanisms that induce the switch from terrestrial to submergence-acclimated leaves may be controlled by the same pathways as described for heterophyllous aquatic plants.},

abstract = {Current estimates of diversifying positive selection rely on first having an accurate multiple sequence alignment. Simulation studies have shown that under biologically plausible conditions, relying on a single estimate of the alignment from commonly used alignment software can lead to unacceptably high false-positive rates in detecting diversifying positive selection. We present a novel statistical method that eliminates excess false positives resulting from alignment error by jointly estimating the degree of positive selection and the alignment under an evolutionary model. Our model treats both substitutions and insertions/deletions as sequence changes on a tree and allows site heterogeneity in the substitution process. We conduct inference starting from unaligned sequence data by integrating over all alignments. This approach naturally accounts for ambiguous alignments without requiring ambiguously aligned sites to be identified and removed prior to analysis. We take a Bayesian approach and conduct inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo to integrate over all alignments on a fixed evolutionary tree topology. We introduce a Bayesian version of the branch-site test and assess the evidence for positive selection using Bayes factors. We compare two models of differing dimensionality using a simple alternative to reversible-jump methods. We also describe a more accurate method of estimating the Bayes factor using Rao-Blackwellization. We then show using simulated data that jointly estimating the alignment and the presence of positive selection solves the problem with excessive false positives from erroneous alignments and has nearly the same power to detect positive selection as when the true alignment is known. We also show that samples taken from the posterior alignment distribution using the software BAli-Phy have substantially lower alignment error compared with MUSCLE, MAFFT, PRANK, and FSA alignments.},

These records are also widely used as a general climate indicator for comparison with local and more specific marine and terrestrial climate proxy records.

The role of wind-driven upwelling, possibly associated with a Tethyan Circumequatorial Current, in controlling Late Cretaceous interior ocean heterogeneity should be the subject of further research.},

abstract = {* Analysis of the phylogenetic similarity of co-occurring species at different spatial scales is increasingly used for decoding community assembly rules. Here, we integrated the analysis of phylobetadiversity and marked point pattern analysis to yield a new metric, the phylogenetic mark correlation function, kd(r), to quantify spatial phylogenetic structure of fully stem-mapped communities. * kd(r) is defined as the expected phylogenetic distance of two heterospecifics separated by spatial distance r, and normalized with the expected phylogenetic distance of two heterospecifics taken randomly from a study area. It measures spatial phylogenetic turnover relative to spatial species turnover and is closely related with the spatially explicit Simpson index. * We used simulated fully stem-mapped plant communities with known spatial phylogenetic structures to assess type I and II errors of the phylogenetic mark correlation function kd(r) under a null model of random phylogenetic spatial structure, and to test the ability of the kd(r) to detect scale-dependent signals of phylogenetic spatial structure. We also compared the performance of the kd(r) with two existing measures of phylobetadiversity that have been previously used to analyse fully stem-mapped plots. Finally, we explored the spatial phylogenetic structure of a 24-ha fully stem-mapped subtropical forest in China. * Simulation tests showed that the new metric yielded correct type I and type II errors and accurately detected the spatial scales at which various processes (e.g. habitat filtering and competition) were invoked to generate spatial phylogenetic structures. The power of the kd(r) was not affected by a phylogenetic signal in species abundance and different topologies of the phylogenetic tree. * Replacing phylogenetic distance by functional distance allows for application of the kd(r) to estimate spatial correlations in functional community structure. Thus, the kd(r) allows trait and phylogenetic structure to be analysed in the same framework. The phylogenetic mark correlation function is a powerful and accurate tool for revealing scale-dependent phylogenetic/functional footprints in community assemblages and allows ecologists to keep up with the increasingly available data of fully stem-mapped plots, functional traits and community phylogenies.},

abstract = {The evolution of lignified xylem allowed for the efficient transport of water under tension, but also exposed the vascular network to the risk of gas emboli and the spread of gas between xylem conduits, thus impeding sap transport to the leaves. A well-known hypothesis proposes that the safety of xylem (its ability to resist embolism formation and spread) should trade off against xylem efficiency (its capacity to transport water). We tested this safety–efficiency hypothesis in branch xylem across 335 angiosperm and 89 gymnosperm species. Safety was considered at three levels: the xylem water potentials where 12{\%}, 50{\%} and 88{\%} of maximal conductivity are lost. Although correlations between safety and efficiency were weak (r 2 {\textless} 0.086), no species had high efficiency and high safety, supporting the idea for a safety–efficiency tradeoff. However, many species had low efficiency and low safety. Species with low efficiency and low safety were weakly associated (r 2 {\textless} 0.02 in most cases) with higher wood density, lower leaf-to sap-wood-area and shorter stature. There appears to be no persuasive explanation for the considerable number of species with both low efficiency and low safety. These species represent a real challenge for understanding the evolution of xylem.},

abstract = {Most existing methods for modeling trait evolution are univariate, although researchers are often interested in investigating evolutionary patterns and processes across multiple traits. Principal components analysis (PCA) is commonly used to reduce the dimensionality of multivariate data so that univariate trait models can be fit to individual principal components. The problem with using standard PCA on phylogenetically structured data has been previously pointed out yet it continues to be widely used in the literature. Here we demonstrate precisely how using standard PCA can mislead inferences: The first few principal components of traits evolved under constant-rate multivariate Brownian motion will appear to have evolved via an "early burst" process. A phylogenetic PCA (pPCA) has been proprosed to alleviate these issues. However, when the true model of trait evolution deviates from the model assumed in the calculation of the pPCA axes, we find that the use of pPCA suffers from similar artifacts as standard PCA. We show that data sets with high effective dimensionality are particularly likely to lead to erroneous inferences. Ultimately, all of the problems we report stem from the same underlying issue-by considering only the first few principal components as univariate traits, we are effectively examining a biased sample of a multivariate pattern. These results highlight the need for truly multivariate phylogenetic comparative methods. As these methods are still being developed, we discuss potential alternative strategies for using and interpreting models fit to univariate axes of multivariate data.},

Herein, we describe a new method for studying evolutionary rate variation in continuously valued characters given an estimate of the phylogenetic history of the species in our study. According to this method, we propose no specific prior hypothesis for how the variation in evolutionary rate is structured throughout the history of the species in our study. Instead, we use a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to estimate evolutionary rates and the shift point between rates on the tree.We do this by simultaneously sampling rates and shift points in proportion to their posterior probability, and then collapsing the posterior sample into an estimate of the parameters of interest. We use simulation to show that the method is quite successful at identifying the phylogenetic position of a shift in the rate of evolution, and that estimated rates are asymptotically unbiased. We also provide an empirical example of the method using data for Anolis lizards.},

abstract = {All comparative analyses rely on at least one phylogenetic hypothesis. However, the reconstruction of the evolutionary history of species is not the pri-mary aim of these studies. In fact, it is rarely the case that a well-resolved, fully matching phylogeny is available for the interspecific trait data at hand. Therefore, phylogenetic information usually needs to be combined across various sources that often rely on different approaches and different markers for the phylogenetic reconstruction. Building hypotheses about the evolutionary history of species is a challenging task, as it requires knowledge about the underlying methodology and an ability to flexibly manipulate data in diverse formats. Although most practi-tioners are not experts in phylogenetics, the appropriate handling of phylogenetic information is crucial for making evolutionary inferences in a comparative study, because the results will be proportional to the underlying phylogeny. In this chapter, we provide an overview on how to interpret and combine phylogenetic information from different sources, and review the various tree-tailoring tech-niques by touching upon issues that are crucial for the understanding of other chapters in this book. We conclude that whichever method is used to generate trees, the phylogenetic hypotheses will always include some uncertainty that should be taken into account in a comparative study.},

abstract = {Volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions are affected by a variety of biotic and abiotic factors such as light intensity, temperature, CO2 and drought. Another stress factor, usually overlooked but very important for the Amazon region, is flooding. We studied the exchange of VOCs in relation to CO2 exchange and transpiration of 8 common tree species from the Amazonian floodplain forest grown up from seeds using a dynamic enclosure system. Analysis of volatile organics was performed by PTR-MS fast online measurements. Our study confirmed emissions of ethanol and acetaldehyde at the beginning of root anoxia after inundation, especially in less anoxia adapted species such as Vatairea guianensis, but not for Hevea spruceana probably due to a better adapted metabolism. In contrast to short-term inundation, long-term flooding of the root system did not result in any emission of ethanol or/and acetaldehyde. Emission of other VOCs, such as isoprenoids, acetone, and methanol exhibited distinct behavior related to the origin (igap{\'{o}} or v{\'{a}}rzea type of floodplain) of the tree species. Also physiological activities exhibited different response patterns for trees from igap{\'{o}} or v{\'{a}}rzea. In general, isoprenoid emissions increased within the course of some days of short-term flooding. After a long period of waterlogging, VOC emissions decreased considerably, along with photosynthesis, transpiration and stomatal conductance. However, even under long-term testing conditions, two tree species did not show any significant decrease or increase in photosynthesis. In order to understand ecophysiological advantages of the different responses we need field investigations with adult tree species.},

abstract = {In Amazonian floodplains, plants are subjected to prolonged periodical flooding with a water column of up to 10 m. Seedlings are submerged, except if they establish in the upper parts of the inundation gradient and grow so fast to be able to maintain some leaves above the water surface. The hypothesis of this study is that there are mainly two strategies for seedling establishment in Amazonian floodplains: tolerance of prolonged submergence vs. escape from submergence. Measurements of height increase in relation to floodplain system and nutrient availability, height in the inundation gradient, and seed mass of 31 common species indicated that the two hypothesized strategies enable efficient seedling establishment on different levels in the flooding gradient. Where submergence is unavoidable, on the lower sites in the flooding gradient, seedlings had significantly lower shoot extension than on the higher sites. Large and small seeds produced seedlings with high shoot elongation, enhancing the chances of non-submergence for the seedlings at high elevations. This pattern was evident also within the family of Fabaceae, taking into account the effect of relatedness among species. In igap?? high seed mass compensated the lack of nutrients of the environment. In nutrient-rich v??rzea, nutrients are supplied by the environment and seeds are smaller, but they may produce seedlings which are just as tall. This emphasizes the strong selective pressure for tall seedlings on high elevations in the flooding gradient. It is assumed that the zonation observed in Amazonian floodplains is directly linked to the flooding tolerance and establishment strategy of the seedlings, and less to the tolerance of the adult trees. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

We demonstrate the method with simulation tests that accurately recover parameters relating to the mode of speciation and source-sink dynamics.

The Arabidopsis genome possesses {\textgreater}600 RLK-encoding genes, some of which are implicated in the perception of environmental signals during the life cycle of the sessile plants. Histidine kinases are also membrane-localized kinases and perceive osmotic stress and plant hormones.

We summarize our recent understanding of their specific roles in stress responses and absicisic acid (ABA) regulation. Elucidation of the functions of these kinases in the osmotic stress response will provide a better understanding of stress-sensing mechanisms in plants and help to identify potential candidate genes for genetic engineering of improved stress-tolerant crops.},

abstract = {Root vacuolar sequestration is one of the best-conserved plant strategies to cope with heavy metal toxicity. Here we report that zinc (Zn) tolerance in Arabidopsis requires the action of a novel Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) transporter. We show that ZIF2 (Zinc-Induced Facilitator 2) localises primarily at the tonoplast of root cortical cells and is a functional transporter able to mediate Zn efflux when heterologously expressed in yeast. By affecting plant tissue partitioning of the metal ion, loss of ZIF2 function exacerbates plant sensitivity to excess Zn, while its overexpression enhances Zn tolerance. The ZIF2 gene is Zn-induced and an intron retention event in its 5'UTR generates two splice variants (ZIF2.1 and ZIF2.2) encoding the same protein. Importantly, high Zn favours production of the longer ZIF2.2 transcript, which compared to ZIF2.1 confers greater Zn tolerance to transgenic plants by promoting higher root Zn immobilization. We show that the retained intron in the ZIF2 5'UTR enhances translation in a Zn-responsive manner, markedly promoting ZIF2 protein expression under excess Zn. Moreover, Zn regulation of translation driven by the ZIF2.2 5'UTR depends largely on a predicted stable stem loop immediately upstream of the start codon that is lost in the ZIF2.1 5'UTR. Collectively, our findings indicate that alternative splicing controls the levels of a Zn-responsive mRNA variant of the ZIF2 transporter to enhance plant tolerance to the metal ion.},

abstract = {AimThe fossil record has led to a historical explanation for forest diversity gradients within the cool parts of the Northern Hemisphere, founded on a limited ability of woody angiosperm clades to adapt to mid-Tertiary cooling. We tested four predictions of how this should be manifested in the phylogenetic structure of 91,340 communities: (1) forests to the north should comprise species from younger clades (families) than forests to the south; (2) average cold tolerance at a local site should be associated with the mean family age (MFA) of species; (3) minimum temperature should account for MFA better than alternative environmental variables; and (4) traits associated with survival in cold climates should evolve under a niche conservatism constraint. LocationThe contiguous United States. MethodsWe extracted angiosperms from the US Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis database. MFA was calculated by assigning age of the family to which each species belongs and averaging across the species in each community. We developed a phylogeny to identify phylogenetic signal in five traits: realized cold tolerance, seed size, seed dispersal mode, leaf phenology and height. Phylogenetic signal representation curves and phylogenetic generalized least squares were used to compare patterns of trait evolution against Brownian motion. Eleven predictors structured at broad or local scales were generated to explore relationships between environment and MFA using random forest and general linear models. ResultsConsistent with predictions, (1) southern communities comprise angiosperm species from older families than northern communities, (2) cold tolerance is the trait most strongly associated with local MFA, (3) minimum temperature in the coldest month is the environmental variable that best describes MFA, broad-scale variables being much stronger correlates than local-scale variables, and (4) the phylogenetic structures of cold tolerance and at least one other trait associated with survivorship in cold climates indicate niche conservatism. Main conclusionsTropical niche conservatism in the face of long-term climate change, probably initiated in the Late Cretaceous associated with the rise of the Rocky Mountains, is a strong driver of the phylogenetic structure of the angiosperm component of forest communities across the USA. However, local deterministic and/or stochastic processes account for perhaps a quarter of the variation in the MFA of local communities.},

Since RGR is usually calculated using destructive harvests of several individuals, an obvious approach is to substitute W-1 and W-2 with sample means (W) over bar (1) and (W) over bar (2). Here we demonstrate that this approach yields a biased estimate of RGR whenever the variance of the natural logarithm-transformed plant weight changes through time. This bias increases with an increase in the variance in RGR, in the length of the interval between harvests, or in sample size. The bias can be avoided by using the formula RGR = ((ln W-2) over bar-(ln W-1) over bar)/(t(2) - t(1)), where (ln W-1) over bar and (ln W-2) over bar are the means of the natural logarithm-transformed plant weights.

abstract = {Vegetation structure is a key determinant of ecosystems and ecosystem function, but paleoecological techniques to quantify it are lacking. We present a method for reconstructing leaf area index (LAI) based on light-dependent morphology of leaf epidermal cells and phytoliths derived from them. Using this proxy, we reconstruct LAI for the Cenozoic (49 million to 11 million years ago) of middle-latitude Patagonia. Our record shows that dense forests opened up by the late Eocene; open forests and shrubland habitats then fluctuated, with a brief middle-Miocene regreening period. Furthermore, endemic herbivorous mammals show accelerated tooth crown height evolution during open, yet relatively grass-free, shrubland habitat intervals. Our Patagonian LAI record provides a high-resolution, sensitive tool with which to dissect terrestrial ecosystem response to changing Southern Ocean conditions during the Cenozoic.},

abstract = {Local adaptations to environmental conditions are of high ecological importance as they determine distribution ranges and likely affect species responses to climate change. Increased environmental stress (warming, extreme drought) due to climate change in combination with decreased genetic mixing due to isolation may lead to stronger local adaptations of geographically marginal than central populations. We experimentally observed local adaptations of three marginal and four central populations of Fagus sylvatica L., the dominant native forest tree, to frost over winter and in spring (late frost). We determined frost hardiness of buds and roots by the relative electrolyte leakage in two common garden experiments. The experiment at the cold site included a continuous warming treatment; the experiment at the warm site included a preceding summer drought manipulation. In both experiments, we found evidence for local adaptation to frost, with stronger signs of local adaptation in marginal populations. Winter frost killed many of the potted individuals at the cold site, with higher survival in the warming treatment and in those populations originating from colder environments. However, we found no difference in winter frost tolerance of buds among populations, implying that bud survival was not the main cue for mortality. Bud late frost tolerance in April differed between populations at the warm site, mainly because of phenological differences in bud break. Increased spring frost tolerance of plants which had experienced drought stress in the preceding summer could also be explained by shifts in phenology. Stronger local adaptations to climate in geographically marginal than central populations imply the potential for adaptation to climate at range edges. In times of climate change, however, it needs to be tested whether locally adapted populations at range margins can successfully adapt further to changing conditions.},

abstract = {Playing a key role in plant growth and development, leaves need to be continuously supplied with water and carbon dioxide to fulfil their photosynthetic function. On its way through the leaf from the xylem to the stomata, water can either move through cell walls or pass from cell to cell to cross the different tissues. Although both pathways are probably used to some degree, evidence is accumulating that living cells contribute substantially to the overall leaf hydraulic conductance (K(leaf)). Transcellular water flow is facilitated and regulated by water channels in the membranes, named aquaporins (AQPs). This review addresses how AQP expression and activity effectively regulate the leaf water balance in normal conditions and modify the cell membrane water permeability in response to different environmental factors, such as irradiance, temperature, and water supply. The role of AQPs in leaf growth and movement, and in CO(2) transport is also discussed.},

abstract = {We investigated the hydraulic properties in relation to soil moisture, leaf habit, and phylogenetic lineage of 17 species of oaks ( Quercus ) that occur sympatrically in northern cen- tral Florida (USA). Leaf area per shoot increased and Huber values (ratio of sapwood area to leaf area) decreased with increasing soil moisture of species' habitats. As a result, maximum hydraulic conductance and maximum transpiration were positively correlated with mean soil moisture when calculated on a sapwood area basis, but not when calculated on a leaf area basis. This reveals the impor- tant role that changes in allometry among closely related species can play in co-ordinating water transport capacity with soil water availability. There were significant differ- ences in specific conductivity between species, but these dif- ferences were not explained by leaf habit or by evolutionary lineage. However, white oaks had significantly smaller aver- age vessel diameters than red oaks or live oaks. Due to their lower Huber values, maximum leaf specific conductivity ( K L ) was higher in evergreen species than in deciduous spe- cies and higher in live oaks than in red oaks or white oaks. There were large differences between species and between evolutionary lineages in freeze–thaw-induced embolism. Deciduous species, on average, showed greater vulnerabil- ity to freezing than evergreen species. This result is strongly influenced by evolutionary lineage. Specifically, white oaks, which are all deciduous, had significantly higher vulnerabil- ity to freezing than live oaks (all evergreen) and red oaks, which include both evergreen and deciduous species. These results highlight the importance of taking evolutionary lin- eage into account in comparative physiological studies.},

abstract = {Biologists generally agree that most morphological variation between closely related species is adaptive. The most common method of comparative analysis to test for co-evolved character variation is based on a Brownian-motion model of character evolution. If we are to test for the evolution of character-covariation, and we believe that characters have evolved adaptively to fill niches during an adaptive radiation, then it is appropriate to employ appropriate models for character evolution. We show here that under several models of adaptive character evolution and coevolution during an adaptive radiation, which result in closely related species being more similar to each other than to more distantly related species, cross-species analyses are statistically more appropriate than contrast analyses. If the evolution of some traits fits the Brownian-motion model, while others evolve to fill niches during an adaptive radiation, it might be necessary to identify the number of relevant niche dimensions and the modes of character evolution before deciding on appropriate statistical procedures. Alternatively, maximum-likelihood procedures might be used to determine appropriate transformations of phylogenetic branch lengths that accord with particular models of character evolution.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: •$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPREMISE OF THE STUDY: Vessels are the chief conduit for long-distance water transport in the majority of flowering plants. Vessel length is a key trait that determines plant hydraulic efficiency and safety, yet relatively little is known about this xylem feature. •$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We used previously published studies to generate a new global data set of vessel length in woody plants. These data were used to examine how evolutionary history, plant habit, environment, and growth ring porosity influenced vessel length. We also examined the relationship between mean vessel length and mean vessel diameter and maximum vessel length. •$\backslash$n$\backslash$nKEY RESULTS: Data on mean vessel length were available for stems of 130 species and on maximum vessel length for stems of 91 species. A phylogenetic analysis indicated that vessel length did not exhibit significant phylogenetic signal. Liana species had longer vessel lengths than in tree or shrub species. Vessel diameter was not predictive of mean vessel length, but maximum vessel length strongly predicted mean vessel length. Vessel length did not vary between species that differed in growth ring porosity. •$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Many traits often assumed to be linked to vessel length, including growth ring porosity and vessel diameter, are not associated with vessel length when compared interspecifically. Sampling for vessel length has been nonrandom, e.g., there are virtually no data available for roots, and sampling for environment has been confounded with sampling for habit. Increased knowledge of vessel length is key to understanding the structure and function of the plant hydraulic pathway.},

abstract = {Understanding the processes maintaining species diversity is a central problem in ecology, with implications for the conservation and management of ecosystems. Although biologists often assume that trait differences between competitors promote diversity, empirical evidence connecting functional traits to the niche differences that stabilize species coexistence is rare. Obtaining such evidence is critical because traits also underlie the average fitness differences driving competitive exclusion, and this complicates efforts to infer community dynamics from phenotypic patterns. We coupled field-parameterized mathematical models of competition between 102 pairs of annual plants with detailed sampling of leaf, seed, root, and whole-plant functional traits to relate phenotypic differences to stabilizing niche and average fitness differences. Single functional traits were often well correlated with average fitness differences between species, indicating that competitive dominance was associated with late phenology, deep rooting, and several other traits. In contrast, single functional traits were poorly correlated with the stabilizing niche differences that promote coexistence. Niche differences could only be described by combinations of traits, corresponding to differentiation between species in multiple ecological dimensions. In addition, several traits were associated with both fitness differences and stabilizing niche differences. These complex relationships between phenotypic differences and the dynamics of competing species argue against the simple use of single functional traits to infer community assembly processes but lay the groundwork for a theoretically justified trait-based community ecology.},

abstract = {Cavitation of xylem elements diminishes the water transport capacity of plants, and quantifying xylem vulnerability to cavitation is important to understanding plant function. Current approaches to analyzing hydraulic conductivity (K) data to infer vulnerability to cavitation suffer from problems such as the use of potentially unrealistic vulnerability curves, difficulty interpreting parameters in these curves, a statistical framework that ignores sampling design, and an overly simplistic view of uncertainty. This study illustrates how two common curves (exponential-sigmoid and Weibull) can be reparameterized in terms of meaningful parameters: maximum conductivity (k(sat)), water potential (-P) at which percentage loss of conductivity (PLC) =X{\%} (P(X)), and the slope of the PLC curve at P(X) (S(X)), a 'sensitivity' index. We provide a hierarchical Bayesian method for fitting the reparameterized curves to K(H) data. We illustrate the method using data for roots and stems of two populations of Juniperus scopulorum and test for differences in k(sat), P(X), and S(X) between different groups. Two important results emerge from this study. First, the Weibull model is preferred because it produces biologically realistic estimates of PLC near P = 0 MPa. Second, stochastic embolisms contribute an important source of uncertainty that should be included in such analyses.},

abstract = {Drought-induced tree mortality has been observed globally and is expected to increase under climate change scenarios, with large potential consequences for the terrestrial carbon sink. Predicting mortality across species is crucial for assessing the effects of climate extremes on forest community biodiversity, composition, and carbon sequestration. However, the physiological traits associated with elevated risk of mortality in diverse ecosystems remain unknown, although these traits could greatly improve understanding and prediction of tree mortality in forests. We performed a meta-analysis on species' mortality rates across 475 species from 33 studies around the globe to assess which traits determine a species' mortality risk. We found that species-specific mortality anomalies from community mortality rate in a given drought were associated with plant hydraulic traits. Across all species, mortality was best predicted by a low hydraulic safety margin-the difference between typical minimum xylem water potential and that causing xylem dysfunction-and xylem vulnerability to embolism. Angiosperms and gymnosperms experienced roughly equal mortality risks. Our results provide broad support for the hypothesis that hydraulic traits capture key mechanisms determining tree death and highlight that physiological traits can improve vegetation model prediction of tree mortality during climate extremes.},

abstract = {There is a long tradition in ecology of studying models of biodiversity at equilibrium. These models, including the influential Neutral Theory of Biodiversity, have been successful at predicting major macroecological patterns, such as species abundance distributions. But they have failed to predict macroevolutionary patterns, such as those captured in phylogenetic trees. Here, we develop a model of biodiversity in which all individuals have identical demographic rates, metacommunity size is allowed to vary stochastically according to population dynamics, and speciation arises naturally from the accumulation of point mutations. We show that this model generates phylogenies matching those observed in nature if the metacommunity is out of equilibrium. We develop a likelihood inference framework that allows fitting our model to empirical phylogenies, and apply this framework to various mammalian families. Our results corroborate the hypothesis that biodiversity dynamics are out of equilibrium.},

abstract = {I. II. III. IV. V. VI. VII. VIII. References Summary Climate change exposes vegetation to unusual drought, causing declines in productivity and increased mortality. Drought responses are hard to anticipate because canopy transpiration and diffusive conductance (G) respond to drying soil and vapor pressure deficit (D) in complex ways. A growing database of hydraulic traits, combined with a parsimonious theory of tree water transport and its regulation, may improve predictions of at-risk vegetation. The theory uses the physics of flow through soil and xylem to quantify how canopy water supply declines with drought and ceases by hydraulic failure. This transpiration ‘supply function' is used to predict a water ‘loss function' by assuming that stomatal regulation exploits transport capacity while avoiding failure. Supply–loss theory incorporates root distribution, hydraulic redistribution, cavitation vulnerability, and cavitation reversal. The theory efficiently defines stomatal responses to D, drying soil, and hydraulic vulnerability. Driving the theory with climate predicts drought-induced loss of plant hydraulic conductance (k), canopy G, carbon assimilation, and productivity. Data lead to the ‘chronic stress hypothesis' wherein {\textgreater} 60{\%} loss of k increases mortality by multiple mechanisms. Supply–loss theory predicts the climatic conditions that push vegetation over this risk threshold. The theory's simplicity and predictive power encourage testing and application in large-scale modeling.},

abstract = {Codon models of evolution have facilitated the interpretation of selective forces operating on genomes. These models, however, assume a single rate of non-synonymous substitution irrespective of the nature of amino acids being exchanged. Recent developments have shown that models which allow for amino acid pairs to have independent rates of substitution offer improved fit over single rate models. However, these approaches have been limited by the necessity for large alignments in their estimation. An alternative approach is to assume that substitution rates between amino acid pairs can be subdivided into rate classes, dependent on the information content of the alignment. However, given the combinatorially large number of such models, an efficient model search strategy is needed. Here we develop a Genetic Algorithm (GA) method for the estimation of such models. A GA is used to assign amino acid substitution pairs to a series of rate classes, where is estimated from the alignment. Other parameters of the phylogenetic Markov model, including substitution rates, character frequencies and branch lengths are estimated using standard maximum likelihood optimization procedures. We apply the GA to empirical alignments and show improved model fit over existing models of codon evolution. Our results suggest that current models are poor approximations of protein evolution and thus gene and organism specific multi-rate models that incorporate amino acid substitution biases are preferred. We further anticipate that the clustering of amino acid substitution rates into classes will be biologically informative, such that genes with similar functions exhibit similar clustering, and hence this clustering will be useful for the evolutionary fingerprinting of genes.},

abstract = {Phenotypic traits and their associated trade-offs have been shown to have globally consistent effects on individual plant physiological functions1–3, but how these effects scale up to influence competition, a key driver of community assembly in terrestrial vegetation, has remained unclear 4. Here we use growth data from more than 3 million trees in over 140,000 plots across the world to show how three key functional traits—wood density, specific leaf area and maximum height—consistently influence competitive interactions. Fast maximum growth of a species was correlated negatively with its wood density in all biomes, and positively with its specific leaf area in most biomes. Low wood density was also correlated with a low ability to tolerate competition and a low competitive effect on neighbours, while high specific leaf area was correlated with a low competitive effect. Thus, traits generate trade-offs between performance with competition versus performance without competition, a fundamental ingredient in the classical hypothesis that the coexistence of plant species is enabled via differentiation in their successional strategies5. Competition within species was stronger than between species, but an increase in trait dissimilarity between species had little influence in weakening competition. No benefit of dissimilarity was detected for specific leaf area or wood density, and only a weak benefit for maximum height. Our trait- based approach to modelling competition makes generalization possible across the forest ecosystems of the world and their highly diverse species composition.},

abstract = {How numerous tree species can coexist in diverse forest communities is a key question in community ecology. Whereas neutral theory assumes that species are adapted to common field conditions and coexist by chance, niche theory predicts that species are functionally different and coexist because they are specialized for different niches. We integrated biophysical principles into a mathematical plant model to determine whether and how functional plant traits and trade-offs may cause functional divergence and niche separation of tree species. We used this model to compare the carbon budget of saplings across 13 co-occurring dry-forest tree species along gradients of light and water availability. We found that species ranged in strategy, from acquisitive species with high carbon budgets at highest resource levels to more conservative species with high tolerances for both shade and drought. The crown leaf area index and nitrogen mass per leaf area drove the functional divergence along the simulated light gradient, which was consistent with observed species distributions along light gradients in the forest. Stomatal coordination to avoid low water potentials or hydraulic failure caused functional divergence along the simulated water gradient, but was not correlated to observed species distributions along the water gradient in the forest. The trait-based biophysical model thus explains how functional traits cause functional divergence across species and whether such divergence contributes to niche separation along resource gradients.},

abstract = {Bryophyte and vascular plant fossils occur at many late Tertiary sites in Alaska and northern Canada. A number of these floras are received here. The oldest flora, possibly of late Early Miocene age, is probably the one from the Mary Sachs gravel at Duck Hawk Bluffs, Banks Island. The youngest are of early Quaternary age. The floras are of several types. The youngest (Cape Deceit Formation) contains only plants that grow in the Arctic and Subarctic today. The Meighen Island Beaufort Formation contains a few extinct taxa ( Aracites globosa ) and fossil plants, such as Sambucus , Comptonia , and Physocarpus , that are not found in the present subarctic and arctic regions of North America. Some of these floras also contain fossils of a five-needle pine that may represent the Japanese Stone pine ( Pinus pumila ). A third group of floras, from Cone Bluff and Lava Camp, Alaska, usually contains more extinct plants ( Epipremnum crassum , Decodon and cf. Paliurus ) as well as fossils of pines in the subsection Cembrae. The Mary Sachs gravel flora, with taxa such as Metasequoia , Glyptostrobus , Taxodium , Juglans , and Liriodendron , stands apart from all three of the above-mentioned floral types. The Mary Sachs gravel flora represents mixed coniferous and hardwood forests. Most of the other floras represent coniferous forests that were floristically richer than present boreal forest. Some of the richness is due to taxa now found only in Eurasia. The Meighen Island Beaufort flora and some of those from the high-level alluvium on Ellesmere Island represent forest tundra. Several lines of evidence show that the Beaufort Formation on Meighen Island in the Canadian Arctic is about 3 million years old. Several of the younger floras contain abundant, well-preserved bryophyte fossils. Unlike the vascular plants, all of them represent extant species.

Recent improvements in plant growth modelling have allowed deeper understanding and more accurate predictions for a wide range of ecological issues, including competition among plants, plant–herbivore interactions and ecosystem function- ing. 2. One challenge in modelling plant growth is that, for a variety of reasons, relative growth rate (RGR) almost universally decreases with increasing size, although traditional calculations assume thatRGR is constant. Nonlinear growth models are flexible enough to account for varying growth rates. 3. We demonstrate a variety of nonlinear models that are appropriate for modelling plant growth and, for each, show how to calculate function-derived growth rates,which allowunbiased compari- sons among species at a common time or size. We show how to propagate uncertainty in estimated parameters to express uncertainty in growth rates. Fitting nonlinear models can be challenging, so we present extensiveworked examples and practical recommendations, all implemented in R. 4. The use of nonlinearmodels coupled with function-derived growth rates can facilitate the testing of novel hypotheses in population and community ecology.For example, the use of such techniques has allowed better understanding of the components of RGR, the costs of rapid growth and the linkage between host and parasite growth rates.Wehope this contribution will demystify nonlinear modelling and persuademore ecologists to use these techniques.},

abstract = {The oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition of soil water (??18Ow and ??Dw hereafter) reflect the history of water through processes such as source evaporation, precipitation and vapor recycling. Temperature, humidity, evaporation, and post-condensation processes can affect ??18Ow and ??Dw. As such, isotope proxy records are often limited in their ability to constrain paleoclimate, paleoecology or paleoelevation without independently corroborating data. Smectite preserves both the hydrogen and oxygen isotope signature of parent water, and therefore provides critical insight into meteoric water line relationships and paleotemperature. Here, we use in situ pedogenic smectite ??18O and ??D records to characterize the evolution of the hydrologic cycle in Cenozoic western North America. We incorporate 192 samples, 119 of which are previously unpublished, from 11 Cenozoic basins representing a range of environments in the Basin and Range, Rocky Mountains and Great Plains. Our results indicate that the processes controlling smectite isotopic compositions vary both regionally and temporally. In some localities such as Oligocene to Pleistocene western Nebraska, change in temperature is the primary control on smectite isotopic composition. In other basins such as in Miocene Trapper Creek, ID, isotope values lie along the meteoric water line, suggesting change in meteoric water composition is responsible for the variation. In most basins, especially those in the Neogene Basin and Range, smectite line slope suggests either evaporation of previously meteoric water or a combination of change in paleotemperature and meteoric water composition. Smectite geothermometry suggests mineral formation temperatures of 30-40??C in the Middle Miocene in the Rocky Mountains, Great Plains and Basin and Range, and a decrease of 10-15??C since the Middle Miocene Climatic Optimum, consistent with clumped isotope and paleofloral temperature estimates. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Efficient methods for accurate and meaningful high-throughput plant phenotyping are limiting the development and breeding of stress-tolerant crops. A number of emerging techniques, specifically remote sensing methods, have been identified as promising tools for plant phenotyping. These remote sensing methods can be used to accurately and rapidly relate variations in leaf optical properties with important plant characteristics, such as chemistry, morphology, and photosynthetic properties at the leaf and canopy scales. In this study, we explored the potential to utilize optical ($\lambda$ = 500-2,400 nm) near-surface remote sensing reflectance spectroscopy to evaluate the effects of ozone pollution on photosynthetic capacity of soybean (Glycine max Merr.). The research was conducted at the Soybean Free Air Concentration Enrichment (SoyFACE) facility where we subjected plants to ambient (44 nL L(-1)) and elevated ozone (79-82 nL L(-1) target) concentrations throughout the growing season. Exposure to elevated ozone resulted in a significant loss of productivity, with the ozone-treated plants displaying a {\~{}}30 {\%} average decrease in seed yield. From leaf reflectance data, it was also clear that elevated ozone decreased leaf nitrogen and chlorophyll content as well as the photochemical reflectance index (PRI), an optical indicator of the epoxidation state of xanthophyll cycle pigments and thus physiological status. We assessed the potential to use leaf reflectance properties and partial least-squares regression (PLSR) modeling as an alternative, rapid approach to standard gas exchange for the estimation of the maximum rates of RuBP carboxylation (V c,max), an important parameter describing plant photosynthetic capacity. While we did not find a significant impact of ozone fumigation on V c,max, standardized to a reference temperature of 25 °C, the PLSR approach provided accurate and precise estimates of V c,max across ambient plots and ozone treatments (r (2) = 0.88 and RMSE = 13.4 $\mu$mol m(-2) s(-1)) based only on the variation in leaf optical properties and despite significant variability in leaf nutritional status. The results of this study illustrate the potential for combining the phenotyping methods used here with high-throughput genotyping methods as a promising approach for elucidating the basis for ozone tolerance in sensitive crops.},

Recent transcriptome-wide analysis of AS using RNA sequencing has revealed that AS is highly pervasive in plants. Pre-mRNAs from over 60{\%} of intron-containing genes undergo AS to produce a vast repertoire of mRNA isoforms. The functions of most splice variants are unknown. However, emerging evidence indicates that splice variants increase the functional diversity of proteins. Furthermore, AS is coupled to transcript stability and translation through nonsense-mediated decay and microRNA-mediated gene regulation. Widespread changes in AS in response to developmental cues and stresses suggest a role for regulated splicing in plant development and stress responses. Here, we review recent progress in uncovering the extent and complexity of the AS landscape in plants, its regulation, and the roles of AS in gene regulation. The prevalence of AS in plants has raised many new questions that require additional studies. New tools based on recent technological advances are allowing genome-wide analysis of RNA elements in transcripts and of chromatin modifications that regulate AS. Application of these tools in plants will provide significant new insights into AS regulation and crosstalk between AS and other layers of gene regulation.},

abstract = {A strong positive correlation between vegetation canopy bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) in the near infrared (NIR) spectral region and foliar mass-based nitrogen concentration ({\%}N) has been reported in some temperate and boreal forests. This relationship, if true, would indicate an additional role for nitrogen in the climate system via its influence on surface albedo and may offer a simple approach for monitoring foliar nitrogen using satellite data. We report, however, that the previously reported correlation is an artifact—it is a consequence of variations in canopy structure, rather than of {\%}N. The data underlying this relationship were collected at sites with varying proportions of foliar nitrogen-poor needleleaf and nitrogen-rich broadleaf species, whose canopy structure differs considerably. When the BRF data are corrected for canopy-structure effects, the residual reflectance variations are negatively related to {\%}N at all wavelengths in the interval 423–855 nm. This suggests that the observed positive correlation between BRF and {\%}N conveys no information about {\%}N. We find that to infer leaf biochemical constituents, e.g., N content, from remotely sensed data, BRF spectra in the interval 710–790 nm provide critical information for correction of structural influences. Our analysis also suggests that surface characteristics of leaves impact remote sensing of its internal constituents. This further decreases the ability to remotely sense canopy foliar nitrogen. Finally, the analysis presented here is generic to the problem of remote sensing of leaf-tissue constituents and is therefore not a specific critique of articles espousing remote sensing of foliar {\%}N.},

abstract = {This review is motivated by the true explosion in the number of recent studies both developing and ameliorating probabilistic models of codon evolution. Traditionally parametric, the first codon models focused on estimating the effects of selective pressure on the protein via an explicit parameter in the maximum likelihood framework. Likelihood ratio tests of nested codon models armed the biologists with powerful tools, which provided unambiguous evidence for positive selection in real data. This, in turn, triggered a new wave of methodological developments. The new generation of models views the codon evolution process in a more sophisticated way, relaxing several mathematical assumptions. These models make a greater use of physicochemical amino acid properties, genetic code machinery, and the large amounts of data from the public domain. The overview of the most recent advances on modeling codon evolution is presented here, and a wide range of their applications to real data is discussed. On the downside, availability of a large variety of models, each accounting for various biological factors, increases the margin for misinterpretation; the biological meaning of certain parameters may vary among models, and model selection procedures also deserve greater attention. Solid understanding of the modeling assumptions and their applicability is essential for successful statistical data analysis.},
